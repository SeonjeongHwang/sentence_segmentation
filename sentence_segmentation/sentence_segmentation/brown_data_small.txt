Dan Morgan told himself he would forget Ann Turner 
He was well rid of her 
He certainly didn't want a wife who was fickle as Ann 
If he had married her he'd have been asking for trouble 
But all of this was rationalization 
Sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann and then could not get back to sleep 
His plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing 
The easiest thing would be to sell out to Al Budd and leave the country but there was a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it 
The best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work 
He found that if he was tired enough at night he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake 
Each day he found himself thinking less often of Ann 
each day the hurt was a little duller a little less poignant 
He had plenty of work to do 
Because the summer was unusually dry and hot the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years 
The grass in the meadows came fast now that the warm weather was here 
He could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows 
He had no idea how much time Budd would give him 
In any case he had no intention of being caught asleep so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his Winchester with him and leaned it against the fence 
He stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon but nothing happened each day dragging out with monotonous calm 
When in late afternoon on the last day in June he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle 
It could be some kind of trick Budd had thought up 
No one walked in this country least of all Ed Dow or Dutch Renfro or any of the rest of the Bar B crew 
Morgan watched the two figures for a time puzzled 
When they were closer and he saw that one was a woman he was more puzzled than ever 
He cleaned his shovel left it against the fence picked up his Winchester and started downstream 
His visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow angling toward the house 
Now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly staggering as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet 
Reaching the house ahead of them he waited with his Winchester in his hands 
They crawled through the north fence and came on toward him and now he saw that both were young not more than nineteen or twenty 
They were dirty their clothes were torn and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door 
She lay there making no effort to get back on her feet 
The boy came on to the porch and sat down his gaze on Morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring 
Morgan hesitated thinking that if this was a trick it was a good one 
He didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending 
The boy licked his dry lips 
He asked Could we have a drink 
Morgan jerked his head toward the front door 
In the kitchen he said 
Leaning his Winchester against the front of the house he walked to the girl 
Get up 
There's water in the house 
She didn't move or say anything 
Her eyes were glazed as if she didn't hear or even see him 
She had reached a point at which she didn't even care how she looked 
Her face was very thin and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling the new skin under it red and angry 
Her blond hair was frowzy her dress torn in several places and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection 
It must have hurt her even to walk for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding 
He picked her up sliding one hand under her shoulders the other under her knees and carried her into the house 
She was amazingly light and so relaxed in his arms that he wasn't even sure she was conscious 
Any lingering suspicion that this was a trick Al Budd had thought up was dispelled 
No girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him 
Besides she had a sweet face that attracted him 
He put her down on the couch and going into the kitchen saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table 
They looked a good deal alike Morgan thought 
Both had blonde hair and blue eyes and there was even a faint similarity of features 
Morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf went back into the front room lifted the girl's head and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth 
She drank greedily and murmured Thank you as he lowered her head 
He stood looking down at her for a moment wondering what could have reduced her to this condition 
He had seen a few nester wagons go through the country the families almost starving to death but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two 
The girl dropped off to sleep 
Morgan returned to the kitchen built a fire and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove 
He brought his Winchester in from the front of the house then faced the boy 
Who are you and what happened to you 
He asked 
I'm Billy Jones the boy answered 
That's my wife Sharon 
We ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two days 
What are you doing here 
Are we in Wyoming 
Morgan nodded 
About five miles north of the line 
Jones sighed as if relieved 
We've been looking for work but all the ranchers have turned us down 
You mean you dragged your wife all over hell's half-acre looking for work 
Morgan demanded 
The town of Buckhorn's only about six miles from here 
Why didn't you go there 
We didn't want town work Jones said 
This is a mighty empty country Morgan said 
There's only one more ranch three miles north of here 
You'd have starved to death if you'd missed both places 
Then we're lucky we got here 
Could you give us a job Mr. 
Morgan 
Dan Morgan 
He was silent a moment thinking he could use a man this time of year and if the girl could cook it would give him more time in the meadows but he knew nothing about the couple 
They might kill him in his sleep thinking there was money in the house 
He dismissed the possibility at once 
The girl's thin face haunted him 
It wasn't the face of a killer 
He wasn't so sure about the boy 
He hadn't shaved for several weeks his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic woebegone expression 
There was more to this than Jones had told him 
They were running from something 
He'd be an idiot to let them stay he thought but he couldn't send them on either 
I could use some help Morgan said finally but I can't afford to pay you anything 
I guess you'd better go on in the morning 
We'll work for our keep the boy said eagerly 
I've been mucking in a mine in the San Juan but I used to work on a ranch 
Sharon she's cooked in a restaurant 
We'll work hard Mr. Morgan 
I'll see Morgan said 
Right now you need a meal and a bath 
Your wife's in terrible shape 
I know Jones said dejectedly 
Morgan filled the fire box with wood again then started supper and set the table 
When the meal was ready he told Jones to wash up and going into the front room woke the girl 
He said I've got some supper ready 
She rubbed her eyes and stretched then sat up her hands going to her hair 
I'm a mess she said and suddenly she was alarmed 
Who are you 
How did we get here 
I'm Dan Morgan 
This is the Rafter Aj 
You fell down in front of the house and I carried you in 
I gave you a drink and then you went to sleep 
Oh 
She stared at him her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said 
then she murmured You're very kind Mr. Morgan 
Do you take in all the strays who come by 
I don't have many strays coming to my front door he said 
Think you can walk to the table 
Of course 
She got to her feet staggered and almost fell 
He caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen 
She sat down at the table shaking her head 
I'm sorry Mr. Morgan 
I'm usually a very strong woman but I'm awfully tired 
And hungry he said 
Start in 
It's not much of a meal but it's what I eat 
Not much of a meal 
The girl cried 
Mr. Morgan it's the best-looking food I ever saw 
He told himself he had never seen two people eat so much 
When they were finally satisfied Jones said I think he's going to give us work 
The grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed of himself 
When he saw the expression in her eyes he knew he couldn't send them on 
She said I guess the Lord looks out for fools drunkards and innocents 
Morgan laughed 
Which are you 
We're not drunkards she said 
That's all I'm sure of 
She helped him with the dishes then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark 
He carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall 
He said You'll feel a lot better after you have a bath 
Your feet are in bad shape Mrs. Jones 
You'll have to go to town to see the doc 
No she'll be all right Jones said quickly 
I mean we don't have any way to get there and we can't expect you to quit work just to take us to town 
We'll see Morgan said 
Could you find me a needle and thread 
The girl asked 
My dress needs some work on it 
He nodded and going into the bedroom brought a needle thread and scissors 
He said I'm going to bed 
He nodded at the door in front of him 
That's my spare bedroom 
The bed isn't made but you'll find plenty of blankets there 
You're awfully kind the girl said 
We'll pay you back if you'll let us 
Some way 
It's all right he said 
I get up early 
You'd better sleep 
Jones followed him into the front room closing the door behind him 
He said If it's all right with you Mr. Morgan I'll sleep out here on the couch 
We haven't slept together since we started 
I just can't take any chances on getting her pregnant and if we were sleeping together 
He stopped embarrassed and Morgan said I understand that but I don't savvy why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place 
We got fired Jones said 
We had to do something 
They were a pair of lost whipped kids Morgan thought as he went to bed 
Gavin paused wearily 
You can't stay here with me 
It's late and you said they'd be here by dawn 
You can't make me go 
Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock 
He was thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had left him there to rock to death on the porch of the Splendide 
It was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt 
Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps terrible to see 
Clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known 
Against that other man he could rally his anger 
against this bent man in the chair he was powerless 
Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had to stoop to catch the words 
Do you remember Big Charlie 
He whispered 
He stuck with me all these years 
Just a half-breed 'pache never said much never meant anythin to me but he stuck with me 
He got into a fight with Tom English your brother's son 
It was a fair fight the boy provoked it Big Charlie told me so 
I believed him 
They killed Big Charlie dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago 
My men they all left me 
Just cleared out 
I didn't understand why Clay 
They just all cleared out 
I treated them fair 
He wiped his lips with a sleeve then stared at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder 
Do you mean he asked almost shyly you want me to go with you wherever you're goin 
Yes 
You don't hate me any more 
Clayton choked shook his head murmuring No 
Come here 
The old man beckoned with one finger and Clayton went forward to him 
Gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely 
All my life he said I tried 
I tried 
I saw you driftin away but I tried 
And you wanted no part of me when I had so much to give 
Now there's nothin left of me 
Laurel is gone my men are gone Ed is dead and you come to me to help me 
Oh 
God in Heaven I can't refuse you now 
That would mock me too much 
Can't let you go way from me again He closed his eyes ashamed of his tears 
I'll go Clay 
Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back 
The eyes followed him fearfully 
The horses 
There isn't much time 
I'll saddle the horses and bring them round 
You get ready 
He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air 
Gavin's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket working by touch in the darkness comforting the animal with easy words 
When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch 
The stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf shaking his head 
Clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck 
The mare had backed away 
You take it easy boy Clayton whispered 
She doesn't want you now 
You take it easy your time will come 
Gavin stood on the porch a thin figure 
He had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand the stock bumping on the wood floor 
Clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps 
Clay he said where are we goin 
To a ranch in the valley 
There's someone there I have to see 
We may take her with us to California 
I don't know yet it's crazy 
I have to think about it 
But California is where we're goin 
California 
Gavin began to nod 
That's a new land 
A man could make a mark there 
Two men together like us we could do somethin fine out there maybe find a place where no one's ever been 
Start out fresh the two of us like nothin had ever happened 
Yes like a father and son 
I made you what you are Gavin whispered 
I made you so you could stand up 
I made you a man 
Yes Gavin you did 
He approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion's quivering neck 
Help me up Clay 
Help me up I feel kind of stiff 
Clayton lifted him gently into the saddle like a child 
I hate to leave my garden Gavin said 
They'll trample it down 
I loved my garden 
It will grow again in California 
I loved this valley he whispered huskily 
Lived alone here for three years before any man came 
Lived alone by the river 
It was nice then so peaceful and quiet 
There was no one but me 
I don't want to leave it 
Clayton swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump 
The two horses broke from the yard from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house into the darkness 
Thirty-five 
they rode at a measured pace through the valley 
Dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest 
The moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light looked primeval as if no man had ever trespassed before 
It looked as Gavin had first seen it years ago on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's wind a savage land untenanted and brooding too strong to be broken by the will of men 
Gavin sighed bitterly 
In that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind 
He saw them ambushed strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying 
In vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately but they would not come to life 
The silence oppressed him made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search 
They passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills 
Then at last the darkness began to dissolve 
A bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky 
The wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies 
They had been seen as soon as they left the ranch picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees 
The two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon crying their intelligence 
The men in Pettigrew's were tired from a night's drinking their faces red and baggy 
But the liquor had flushed their courage 
They greeted the news angrily as though they had been cheated of purpose 
Lester heard their muttering saw their eyes reveal their desire 
He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat dry and cracked 
He's leavin 
That's what you wanted isn't it 
Clayton is with him takin him out of the valley 
You can't 
Keep out of this Purvis snarled 
He's not your brother he's Gavin's son 
You see he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone 
Joe Purvis was thinking back many years 
First he thought of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley 
He remembered Gavin's smirk his own cringing feeling his impotence 
Then he thought of a time when Clayton's horse had fallen lame in the Gap 
His wife had said to him Nellie is in love with Clayton Roy 
He wouldn't even dance with her at Gavin's party 
He treats her like she was dirt 
And you stand by like a fool and let him do it 
He remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water 
It was the night Clayton had tricked them in the poker game 
You're Gavin's son Joe Purvis had said 
He turned to Lester 
You brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy 
He meant to help Gavin all the time 
He made a fool of you Lester 
He swung round to the other men We can catch him easy 
There are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place 
If we let them go they won't stay away they'll find men to ride with them and they'll be back 
There's only one way they can get out now and that's through the Gap if we ride hard we can take them 
Lester's hand fluttered to Cabot's shoulder 
The boy jerked away 
He killed Tom do you understand that 
Cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night 
He fled through the door and down the steps running and the men grunted and followed pushing Lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light 
Purvis and Silas Pettigrew were the last to leave 
They mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance 
Thirty-six 
in the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear 
The clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow 
When they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them strung out on the prairie in a flat black line 
The wind of their running was cold and wild the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind 
The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion 
He looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers 
They neither gained nor fell back 
He rode low on the mare's neck 
Ahead of him Gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the Gap no more than a mile away 
Gavin's face was bloodless with excitement 
He did not look back 
he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north 
He knew who was riding after him the men he had known all his life the men who had worked for him sworn their loyalty to him 
Now they were riding to kill him 
And he was fleeing running fleeing his death and his life at the same time 
The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in his valley 
With every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his that he would never see again 
The Gap looming before him the place where had confronted Jack English on that day so many years ago was his exit from all that had meaning to him 
California is too far he thought 
He would never reach California 
He was too old when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead he was passing from life 
The sentry was not dead 
He was in fact showing signs of reviving 
He had been carrying an Enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol 
A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard 
He was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat 
Mike stripped these from him and donned them 
He and Dean tied and gagged the man using his belt and shirt for the purpose 
They dragged him inside the building 
Fiske joined them unsteady on his feet 
Julia seeing the bandage rushed to him 
You are hurt 
She breathed 
I never felt better in my life Fiske blustered 
He turned to Susan and kissed her on the cheek 
Thank you My dear he said 
You are very brave 
Mike silenced them 
We'll talk later 
First we've got to get out of here 
We'll grab horses Dean said 
The main bunch is outside but there are some over there inside the wall 
Mike debated it trying to decide whether Fiske was strong enough to ride 
But it at least offered him a chance for living 
He had none here 
And for the sake of Julia and Susan it had to be tried 
The guerrilla bivouac remained silent 
Light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground 
Someone evidently was on duty there 
No doubt there would be men guarding the horses 
About a dozen animals were held inside the stockade as best Mike could make out in the moonlight 
Evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency 
He handed the guard's rifle to Fiske 
Dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride he said 
We'll stampede the rest 
You stay with the ladies 
All of you be ready to ride hell for leather 
He added If this doesn't work out the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms with them 
He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol 
Susan halted Dean and kissed him 
She clung to him talking to him and dabbing at her eyes 
Mike turned away 
He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant what he had believed it had 
He felt unutterably weary 
Dean turned from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms 
He kissed her also and with deep tenderness 
She too began to weep 
He released her and joined Mike 
All right he said 
Mike only said Later 
Be careful McLish 
Susan said fiercely 
The way you were careful 
He snorted 
Running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock 
He kept going 
He wanted no more sentimental scenes with her 
He might say or do something foolish 
Something all of them would regret 
He might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself pretending to be blind to the way Julia Fortune had taken Dean's affections from her 
And using him Mike McLish as a sop to her pride 
He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol 
Stay well back of me he said 
I'm going to walk up to the horses bold as brass pretending I'm one of the guerrillas 
There's bound to be someone on guard but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close 
Holding the pistol concealed he walked to the rear wall of the stockade 
It was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings 
One wing stood open 
Mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses 
They were tethered army style on stable lines 
A voice spoke near-at-hand 
Who's that 
Just me Mike said 
Is that you Bill 
He located his man 
The guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight 
Mike kept walking and got within arm's reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch 
Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol 
But the luck that had been running their way left him 
The guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle 
He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's body 
Mike off balance managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded 
The bullet went wide 
Mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash 
This time it connected solidly on the man's temple felling him 
The explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills 
The startled horses began rearing on their tethers 
Dean came rushing up 
Are you hit 
He demanded 
No but the fat's in the fire 
Mike said 
There's no chance now of all of us getting away 
You'll have to try it alone 
The sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby having been kept handy in case of need 
Mike took the bayonet from Dean's hand and slashed the picket line 
Up you go 
He said 
Ride 
Dean resisted Mike's attempt to push him toward the horse 
Why not you 
He protested 
Dammit 
Mike said frantically 
You're lighter than me 
It's our only chance now 
Try to find these Feds 
The rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back 
You're the one that's taking the big chance 
Dean still hesitated but Mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand 
No telling how good this horse is Mike panted 
Favor him and save something in case you hit trouble 
Watch out for Apaches when it comes daylight 
Take the pistol 
You might need it 
We'll still have the rifle and I might be able to round up some more 
I'll stampede the rest of these horses so they can't chase you 
Dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back 
McLish he said as he kicked the horse into motion I'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again 
Then he was on his way at a gallop 
Mike ran down the line slashing picket ropes with the bayonet 
He lifted a screeching war whoop 
That touched off a total stampede 
He darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there 
These poured through the gate and joined the flight 
The animals thundered away into the moonlight heading for the ridges 
The guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure 
Apaches 
Mike yelled 
They're stealin' the stock 
He scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings 
He crouched there 
His shout had been taken up and repeated 
The guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses 
All were carrying guns they had seized up but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all 
Durkin and Calhoun came running from the post 
They had pistols in their hands 
They bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar 
They followed the others toward the east gate 
Beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were Apaches 
Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings 
He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner 
The area was deserted 
A man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left but he too suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade 
Mike crawled to the door and peered in 
The orderly room seemed to be deserted 
A lantern hung from a peg giving light 
Ducking inside he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner 
A brace of pistols holstered on belts hung from a peg along with ammunition pouches 
An ammunition case stood open containing canisters which contained powder cartridges 
Mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty 
Shouldering the load he peered from the door 
His looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas 
He looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons struck by a new inspiration 
He set his bundle down 
Snatching the lantern from its peg he shattered its globe with a blow against a post 
He picked up the powder canister and ran out 
Bursting paper cartridges he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it 
He shouldered the blanket again backed off and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon 
He turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house 
Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon 
The stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him 
They realized the truth 
Bullets began to snap past him 
One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack 
Its force spun him around but he recovered and got into stride again 
A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety 
Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down 
Guerrillas were racing toward him 
Susan and Julia came from the door and dragged him with them 
The three of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap 
Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door 
She crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal chewing into the planks 
Some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak 
The iron hinges held but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars 
Mike rolled to Susan grasped her around the knees dragging her off her feet 
He hovered over her to shield her for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls 
He peered from a loophole 
Guerrillas were only a dozen yards away charging the house 
Mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired 
He dropped a man with the first bullet 
At the same moment Wheeler Fiske fired the rifle Mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit 
That halted the rush 
The guerrillas scattered for cover 
The wagons were burning fiercely 
The mudwagon had caught fire also 
The blaze was spreading to the frame buildings 
The guerrillas realized they faced a new problem 
Gawdamighty 
One screeched 
There goes our grub an' ammunition 
Get a bucket line going 
Calhoun shouted 
Hurry 
Hurry 
The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring 
But what few containers they found were inadequate 
Many of them in increasing panic came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort 
Both buildings were in flames 
The heat drove the guerrillas back 
The roof of the command post began to buckle 
Drag the wagons to the spring 
Lew Durkin yelled 
Run 'em right into the spring 
Hustle 
One of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame 
A sizable supply of powder had been touched off 
The wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings 
The glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows giving light enough to examine Mike's wound 
The bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor 
But it had missed the bone and had passed on through 
Susan and Julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury 
Mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it 
So it wasn't the earthquake that made him return to his village 
No 
Now dammit I don't want to go into any more explanations 
Here comes Jason 
Keep this to yourself 
Reverend Jason looking worried hurried toward us 
Anything wrong cap'n 
The men seem to think so 
Dirion found a large war party south of us 
They'll probably attack at dawn Montero said 
He brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp 
Using his hands as a trumpet he shouted Fort up 
Fort up 
There's a large war party on their way 
For a second engages cooks voyageurs appeared struck dumb 
Then Little Billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal 
They all flew into action 
That was a terrible thing to do I said to Oso 
The Aricaras treated us like friends 
And here all the time you knew the Sioux would be using our rifles on them 
God what a world you people live in 
Oso gave me an unruffled look 
Old Knife's got the largest war party ever seen on the river he said calmly 
What would you have done in Montero's moccasins 
Let Old Knife come up and kill you and your people or would you steer him on someone else 
He shook his head 
Mr. Manuel did that in the war 
That's why the British never got the tribes to fight for the King 
Mr. Manuel whispered in the ears of the Sioux that the Cheyennes were comin' to raid 'em for their horses 
Then he went on to the Cheyennes and told them that the Sioux was goin' to move up 
He did that with all the Nations 
Hell they were fightin' each other so hard they had no time for anyone else 
The War Department wrote Mr. Manuel a letter and said he was a hero 
I saw that letter 
He carried it in a little wallet made of fish skin 
But that was war I said 
There's no war on now 
You're wrong Matt 
In this country there's a war on every time the grass turns green 
First it was the Nations against themselves then it was them against the whites 
And it's goin' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land 
I remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight 
That's why this company's important 
Once we get over the mountains others will come along 
That's why the Trust don't want us to make it 
That bastard Chambers 
Old Knife's not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work 
Before we get through he'll have the Blackfeet hankerin' for our hair and our goods 
Well talkin' ain't goin' to help let's fort up 
As I dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection I grudgingly found myself agreeing with Oso's logic especially when I imagined what would have happened to Missy if Old Knife's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company 
For unlike the Sioux and the Crows the Aricaras are not great horsemen nor are they aggressive like the savage Blackfeet 
More of an agricultural nation they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains 
Still I was disgusted with myself for agreeing with Montero's methods 
Surprisingly he had told the others what he had done 
In the brief moment I had to talk to them before I took my post on the ring of defenses I indicated I was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river 
I think Montero did right Amy said firmly 
Let the savages kill each other 
What do we care 
Reverend Jason was understandably bitter 
It was a terrible thing to do 
Those little children 

But Oso replied calmly Trouble ain't easy to dodge out in this country rev'rend 
28 
Attack 
Gray Eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky 
Our camp was in the center of a wide valley 
Montero had set up a strong position using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush 
He had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire 
The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense 
the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible 
Wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors 
The cooks had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time and on Montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day 
Buckets were filled the herd fed and watered 
The worst part had been the waiting 
although we didn't expect the attack before dawn the long cloudy night filled with the sounds of the industrious insects seemed endless 
Coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling Indian scouts the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl 
Oso slept unconcernedly his rifle cradled in his arms 
I didn't catch a wink 
Every time I closed my eyes I saw Gray Eyes rushing at me with a knife 
It was a relief when they finally came 
They poured through the opening in the valley then spread out in a long line to come at us brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry 
Oso Montero called I'll get Gray Eyes 
That'll be a pleasure to see the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle 
Hold your fire Montero was shouting 
Wait until my shot 
I'll shoot the first man who doesn't 
I could see them in my sights 
They were about a mile off 
under me the ground quivered slightly 
At first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies hunched over their horses' heads 
Gradually they emerged as men 
Gray Eyes was in the lead 
His face was split by a vermilion streak his eyes were pools of white 
jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest 
He was naked except for a clout 
Next to him was a young boy I was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions 
His mouth was open his neck corded with the strain of his screams 
I found his chest in my sights 
It had a red circle 
The circle came nearer and nearer 
My God how long is he going to wait I thought 
Montero's rifle cracked 
At first I thought he had missed 
Gray Eyes remained erect 
The feathered lance was still above his head 
As he started to slump over another warrior swung him onto his horse 
I squeezed the trigger 
At the last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony 
I saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head bouncing like a rubber ball 
He started to run but Oso's shot caught him on the wing 
He jerked once in the grass and lay still 
If you're goin' to kill 'em 
Kill 'em 
Oso growled 
What else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides 
The Aricaras broke under the devastating fire wheeled and retreated 
Lead up 
Lead up 
They'll be back 
Montero was shouting 
Far up the valley I could see the Rees circling and reorganizing 
Out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men war shields lances blankets and wounded and dead horses 
The morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood the acrid stench of frightened horses and the bitterness of burned powder 
A horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy 
A rifle cracked 
the square head fell over 
One of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek 
His legs pumped furiously his long black hair streamed out behind him 
There was a ragged volley 
He was dead before he hit the ground 
For Christ's sake don't waste your powder on one of 'em 
Montero shouted furiously 
Wait for the charge 
The charge I tell you 
The sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint 
They grew louder as the Indians charged again 
I could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease their mouths open shouting their spine-chilling cries 
Gray Eyes is back Montero said 
The war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat 
I could see the blood running down his chest 
He was riding between two warriors who held him erect when he started to slump 
I forgot to aim 
In my sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger 
Montero's shot had caught him high in the chest 
there was no doubt he was dying 
Again we waited for Montero 
This time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically but they held their fire 
The horses were only several lengths away when he fired 
The bullet flung Gray Eyes from his horse 
Our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts 
But a few reached our wall 
I heard the whir of an ax and a Canadian's face burst apart in a bloody spray 
I saw Little Billy rise and fire almost point blank and an Indian's face became shattered flesh and bone 
A second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight 
Men screamed 
Oso reached up jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck 
Other Indians were running at the ponies shrilling and waving blankets 
Reverend Jason got one the Canadians the others 
I saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot then run back to his position 
The ponies were almost uncontrollable 
The pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the Aricaras charged again 
This time more of them hurdled the barrier 
A small Indian dived at Montero who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt 
It sounded like a man kicking a melon 
Above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales 
Although my shot killed his horse he rolled off the bale on top of me 
I could smell woodsmoke grease and oil 
His eyes were dark fluid fearful and he gave a sigh as my knife went in 
Coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil 
Now under me I could see him for what he really was a boy dressed up in streaks of paint 
The Aricaras made one last desperate charge 
It was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors old and young wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam slam of the cruelly efficient Hawkinses 
Others badly wounded gripped hands in manes knees in bellies held on as long as possible and then weak from ghastly wounds slipped sideways slowly almost thoughtfully to be broken under the slashing hoofs 
Some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts 
None of them reached our walls again 
The few survivors grudgingly turned away 
In the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song 
She was carrying a quirt and she started to raise it then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist 
I saw your fire she said speaking slowly making an effort to control her anger 
You could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size 
It wouldn't matter to a fool like you 
It would to me 
All right Wilson said quickly 
The fire's too big 
And I appreciate the advice 
He was losing patience again 
An hour before with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness he would have appreciated company 
She had helped him change his mind 
I'm not advising you she said 
I'm telling you 
That fire's too big 
Let it burn down 
And make sure it's out when you leave in the morning 
He was taken aback 
It took him a long time to compose himself 
There's some mistake he said finally 
You're right about the fire 
It's bigger than it has to be though I don't see where it's doing any harm 
But you're wrong about the rest of it 
I'm not leaving in the morning 
Why should I 
I own the place 
She showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face 
It didn't seem to tell her anything 
She glanced around the clearing taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground the two kids the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight 
She studied it for a long time 
Then she turned back to Wilson and smiled and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it 
You own this place 
She said and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly 
You bought it 
From a man in St. Louis Wilson said 
Jake Carwood 
Maybe you know him 
The girl laughed 
I know him 
I ought to 
My father ran him off here six years ago 
Wilson didn't say anything 
He stood watching the girl wondering what was coming next 
She had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him 
Carwood didn't tell you that she said 
No Wilson said 
But it's understandable 
It's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of 
And it doesn't make any difference 
He sold me a clear title 
I have it with me right here 
If you want to see 
Never mind she said sternly 
It wouldn't matter to my father and not to me 
I meant what I said about that fire 
Be sure it's out when you leave 
That's all 
I'll let you go back to doing the dishes now 
It was meant to insult him and didn't quite succeed 
He took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly and it was his turn to smile now 
I don't mind washing dishes now and then he said pleasantly 
It doesn't hurt 
It might hurt you though 
Somebody might mistake you for a woman 
He meant to say more but he never got the chance 
She was quick 
She brought the quirt down slashing it across his cheek and he tried to step back 
She swung the quirt again and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle 
She came down against him and he tried to break her fall 
He grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him 
It made him a little sick and he let go of her 
He got up slowly and she was already on her feet and he stood facing her 
He wiped the blood from his cheek 
I ought to he said 
He was shaking with anger his breath coming in long painful gasps 
That quirt I ought to use it on you where it would do the most good 
If you were a man 
She isn't mister 
The voice came from behind him and Wilson turned 
The fire had gone down and the man was only a shadow against the trees 
But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light and Wilson had a good look at him 
He was tall and dark-skinned a half-breed Wilson thought 
And he was handsome despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek 
She's not a man mister he said 
I am 
If you've got any ideas 
He raised the Winchester and pointed it at Wilson's chest 
Put the rifle down Joseph the girl said 
She seemed irritated 
I thought I told you to stay home 
The half-breed eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap 
The scar looked pure white in the half-darkness 
his eyes were black and deep-set and expressionless 
You shouldn't be riding up here after dark Judith he said quietly 
I can take care of this 
It's no job for you 
The girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him 
He took it without flinching 
I said go home Joseph 
You've got no business up here 
The half-breed didn't answer this time 
But the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth and his eyes were hurt and angry 
It made Wilson wonder 
He watched the half-breed as he turned silently 
They could hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a while then the sound faded out 
Wilson brushed the dust from his coat 
Who was that 
He asked 
Your personal guard 
You're pretty hard on him 
He works for my father the girl said and then seemed to change her mind 
He's a friend 
His name's Joseph Sanchez 
Is there anything else you want to know 
Not now Wilson said 
I guess I'll find out soon enough 
You've got blood on your cheek 
Not yours 
Mine 
It must have got there when you fell against me 
She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat 
I'll bet that's as close as you've been to a man since you were a baby Wilson said 
He saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt and he grabbed her wrist 
Oh no he said and he was without humor now 
I've had enough of that 
I've had enough of you 
I don't know what goes on around here and I don't care 
I don't know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business and I don't care about that either 
You took me by surprise 
But I'll know how to handle you next time 
She brought up her free hand to hit him but this time he was quicker 
He side-stepped her blow and she fell stumbling against the gelding 
She finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle 
Her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders held by the string and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before 
He had forgotten that she was so pretty 
But her prettiness was what he had noticed first and all the other things had come afterward cruelty meanness self-will 
He had known women like that one woman in particular 
And one had been too many 
He watched the girl until she had gone into the trees and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer then went up to where the children were sleeping 
They weren't sleeping of course but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending 
He hadn't shown up too well in their eyes letting himself be browbeaten by a woman 
They expected greater things from him regardless of how trying the circumstances and they were disappointed 
And determined not to show it 
They lay a little too stiffly with their eyes straining to stay closed 
Go to sleep he said 
Both of you 
There's better things to do than listen to something like that 
I'll be down at the creek finishing the dishes if you want me 
He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream 
The coyote was calling again and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it 
Not tonight at any rate 
He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble 
If she did he could stand it better in the light 
He scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out 
That afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house his hopes had been high 
Already some of the pain had gone from Amelia's death 
Not all of it 
There would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief 
But they were starting a new life 
And they had almost everything they needed land a house two whiteface bulls three horses 
The land wasn't all Wilson had expected of it 
Six hundred and forty acres the old man back in St. Louis had said 
good grass good water 
Well the grass was there though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it 
The water was there so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard 
And there was a house 
livable perhaps but badly in need of repairs 
In the last analysis though Wilson had little cause to complain 
The place had been cheap just the little he had left after Amelia's burial and it would serve its purpose 
There was only one place where Jake Carwood's description had gone badly awry the peace and quiet 
It hadn't started out that way 
And he had a feeling thanks to the girl that things would get worse before they got better 
2 
They had the house cleaned up by noon and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses 
He stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness and finally went over to help him 
Kathy was already in the wagon 
They were going to town and they were both excited 
Wilson backed the team into the traces and wished they weren't going to town at all 
He had an uneasy feeling about it 
That girl last night what was her name 
Judith Pierce 
It was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember 
He finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him 
He had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than Judith Pierce had made it seem 
There was brush and stands of pine that no grass could grow under and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to graze 
But there was water 
There was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard 
Yes there was plenty of water too much and that was probably the trouble 
There were tracks of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres 
The first part of the road was steep but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley 
It was hotter once they reached the flat and drier but the grass was better 
A warm breeze played across it moving it like waves 
A red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road 
It took them an hour before they came to the first houses of Kelseyville 
The town was about what Wilson expected one main street with its rows of false-fronted buildings a water tower a few warehouses a single hotel 
all dusty and sunbaked 
The place was quiet 
Such was my state of mind that I did not question the possibility of this 
under the circumstances I was only too willing to confess all 
I was nearly thirty at the time 
I went to the hall in the afternoons only on these preliminary matters 
It was dark and I sensed very large 
only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it 
Sometimes I was aware of people moving about in the darkness 
I would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but I never quite succeeded 
A glimpse of three of four vague figures at the most 
Drifting here and there 
Squatting as if waiting 
The pulsing glow of a cigarette 
Since they could see me but I not them their presence in the hall disturbed me 
The clerk paid them no attention 
This impressed me until I realized how limited was his sphere of influence 
His job simply consisted in registering new men 
When the phone rang he answered it 
His authority extended to the far edge of the counter no further 
None of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him 
Baldness was attacking his pate 
He spoke to me in a gruff voice an affectation which quite belied his personality 
He wore his white shirt open at the neck revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath 
It was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was 
But it was not easy for him and he often slipped 
When one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle I noticed how the clerk winced 
I felt certain he was really a spineless little man 
His hat the cause of his baldness 
hung on a hook on the wall and underneath it I could see his tie knotted ready to be slipped over his head a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck 
The morning's tabloids were on the counter and a stack of dog-eared men's magazines 
On a shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music 
Everything about the clerk was trivial 
Once pressing him I learned that his job was only part-time in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall 
Noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person 
With distaste I saw him assume a pompous air 
When he saw me coming he turned his radio off 
He made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf 
He would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence then bark into it with gruff importance 
What limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me 
In the mornings I was informed fluorescent tubes similar to the one above the counter illuminated the entire hall 
They and the two large fans which I could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents down at the far end of the hall could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office 
He pointed out the switch to me and for a moment I foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words 
I was shown instead a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out he told me every morning 
Now here was something of obvious importance to me yet when I reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand 
He couldn't afford to have anyone mess around with them he said 
Each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient 
I withdrew my hand 
Later I would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket 
Having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed I gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself 
When suitably lighted what would it look like 
The presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air 
One afternoon upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk I had visited the toilet adjoining the hall 
By counting the number of stalls and urinals I attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time 
For although I had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet I still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended 
I could observe the two fans down at the end but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as I had no measure of comparison 
I had for some time been hoping in vain for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself 
I knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall but what they were doing and exactly where I could not tell 
It was I felt possible that they were men who having received no tickets for that day had remained in the hall to sleep perhaps in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light 
This light did not penetrate very far back into the hall and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when I tried to pick out whatever might be lying or squatting on the floor below 
Also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder 
No sooner would I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me at times quite sharply in order to bring back my attention 
And I had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office flicked off and on impatiently 
This sort of petty vigilance annoyed me 
I felt certain it was self-appointed 
It sprang from a type of mentality I'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here 
I decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed 
I felt strongly attached to the hall however and hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance 
I lived in a state of suspense because of it 
I could not cling to my past nor did I wish to 
I had signed it off on the forms 
My future lay solely with the hall yet what did I know about the hall at this point 
Although I had been inside it I had not yet seen it functioning 
I wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes I ought to be wearing 
I did not despair however 
far from it 
I was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall 
Though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town its character was wholly foreign to me 
Large warehouses flanked the street on which the hall fronted 
The river was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it 
Sometimes I noticed the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs 
The sounds issuing from beyond winches whirring men shouting indicated great activity and excited me 
The hall on the other hand appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons 
It resembled nothing I'd ever seen before 
Its front was windowless but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows now blinded had once looked out upon the street 
I kept circling the block hoping to see from the street behind it the rear of the hall 
But it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it 
For weeks I wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages truck terminals and taxi repair shops gasoline pumps and longshoremen's lunch counters yet never did I cease to feel myself a stranger there 
I returned to the hall despite my dislike for the clerk 
As I had expected he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application 
Meanwhile spring had passed well into summer 
At last when I put it to him directly the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual 
When I asked him what if anything I could do about it he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall 
I could consult this personage on any weekday morning though not before ten o'clock 
The clerk impressed this upon me that I should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock 
When I went for my interview with the director I saw why 
Although it was dark as usual I could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people 
Cigarette butts littered the floor 
The big fans were going drawing from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about in pale strata underneath the ceiling 
I had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs 
The staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men 
I stopped by the counter 
No one was behind it but in the rear wall of the office I noticed for the first time a door which had been left partially open 
Past it I could see part part of a desk a flag in a corner a rug on the floor 
The director's office 
I rapped my knuckles on the counter 
The director came to the door 
I was at once disappointed although just what I had expected him to look like I could not have explained 
He was a man in his late forties with graying hair of medium height 
he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar 
He wore perforated white-topped shoes 
they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment 
But he came toward me sedately enough showed me around the counter offered me a seat inside his office then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application 
I had the impression that he had read my forms perhaps several times 
He did not look at them now 
As he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk I wondered what this dapper slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall 
He spoke in a voice as immaculate as his appearance 
Why had I registered 
Begging my pardon he must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall 
He had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there 
indeed my scholastic qualifications were such that he a college graduate himself must envy me them 
Was I sure he asked that I knew what I was applying for 
What sort of men I would come into contact with at the hall 
These questions did not surprise me 
I felt certain that the director like the afternoon clerk seldom moved beyond the counter that the hall to them was a jungle a dark and unwelcome place 
Though I doubted that he would understand me I told the director my motives for applying 
I had always I said hankered after working hard with my hands 
This desire I went on growing voluble as my conviction was aroused had mounted at such a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing 
To this effect I had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence 
The flat hard cap was small but he thrust it to the back of his head 
Tie him up 
Hell with it 
Before they could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered head hard 
The man went over without sound falling to the bare floor 
Barton said harshly Why did you do that 
Rankin sneered at him 
What did you want me to do kiss him 
He dumped me in solitary twice 
Barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him around 
Let's get one thing straight you and me 
The only reason we brought you was to get Miller out 
If you ever try anything without my orders I'll kill you 
Fred Rankin looked at him 
It seemed to Barton that the green eyes mocked him the thin-lipped smile held insolence but he had no time to waste now 
Come on 
Let's move 
They filed out through the guard-room door into the paved square 
There were three other men within this prison whom Barton would have liked to liberate but they were in other cell blocks 
There was no chance 
They moved slowly toward the main gate following the wall 
There was no moon 
They had chosen this night purposely 
They reached the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above and Powers slipped through the door 
Two men were on duty inside playing pinochle relaxed 
They looked up in surprise as Powers came in 
What are you doing out of the block 
It's Curtiss he said naming the man Rankin had hit 
I've got to have help 
They stared at him 
The sergeant in charge climbed to his feet 
What's wrong with him 
He's having some kind of a fit 
The sergeant turned to the door 
As he passed through it Barton shoved his gun against the man's side 
One sound and you're dead 
The sergeant froze 
Powers had not followed 
Powers was covering the remaining guard 
The man half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell 
Powers knocked his arm aside 
Deliberately with none of Rankin's viciousness he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard's head 
They were free 
Even Barton could not quite believe it 
It had gone without a hitch 
They slid through the wicket in the big gate ghosted across the dark ground 
Five minutes later they reached the horses 
Barton was relieved to see that Carl Dill and Emmett Foster had brought extra mounts 
He had been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the escape party they would be short 
No one hurried 
They walked the horses heading along the river Barton and Emmett Foster in the lead seven men riding quietly through the night 
The only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards three the striped suits of convicts 
Five miles 
In a small grove against the river they halted turning deep into the protection of the trees 
Foster had brought extra clothing also 
A good man Emmett 
He had been one of the original Night Riders one who had escaped the trial 
It was to him that Barton had sent Carl Dill on Dill's release from the prison 
Clyde Miller was crying softly to himself shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants the worn brown shirt 
Kid Boyd was unusually silent Rankin watchful a few paces apart 
Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to Powers 
I won't even try to thank you 
The ex-prison guard was embarrassed 
He said in a studied voice I didn't do it for you 
I did it for the valley 
You're the only man the Night Riders will follow 
We've been starving and I don't like to starve 
Barton turned away his eyes falling upon Rankin beside his horse 
Good luck 
The murderer lifted his head 
Meaning you want me to ride out 
You aren't one of us 
There's nothing for you here 
I got no place to go 
Barton hesitated 
He did not trust Rankin his violent temper his killer instinct 
But ten years in prison had taught him realities 
They were in a fight outweighed in both numbers and money 
It was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses to call them Night Riders to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure 
But if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals men who knew how to use a gun against men who would match the killers on the other side 
Your choice he said briefly and turned to Kid Boyd 
Bury those uniforms so they won't be found 
Then Barton touched Carl Dill's arm and moved off up the river bank 
He wanted a careful uninterrupted report from Dill on the conditions in the valley 
They squatted on their heels in the deep mud and Dill found a cigar in his breast pocket passing it over silently 
He too knew the agony of going for weeks sometimes months without the solace of tobacco 
Mitchell Barton drew in the fragrance deeply letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhaled 
Through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly 
For his first five years in prison they had shared a cell 
Carl Dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man 
He had been the auditor for the mining syndicate and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate's money 
He had done time for the theft 
The one thing they had in common was their hatred 
Both hated Donald Kruger 
It had drawn them together and since his release from prison Dill had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape 
He said now I've got the perfect headquarters set up 
The old Haskell mine 
Mitch Barton knew the place 
Twenty years before a group of Easterners had bought out the Haskell claims in the rocky hills south of Grass Valley 
They had spent a million dollars carving in a road putting up buildings drilling their haulage tunnel 
Then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned 
The road's washed badly said Dill but there's a trail you can get over with a horse 
A company of cavalry couldn't come in there if two men were guarding that trail 
Barton nodded 
How do the valley people feel 
As mad as ever 
But Kruger's men keep them off balance and they don't trust me 
I'm an outsider 
When they learn you're in the hills though they'll rally don't worry about that 
Barton waited for a long moment then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind 
My boy 
Did you find him 
Dill was silent as if he hated to answer and Barton had a cold sick feeling of apprehension 
He's in Morgan's Ferry 
Barton half-straightened in surprise 
What's he doing there 
Again Dill hesitated 
Dealing faro 
Dealing faro 
How come 
Your sister-in-law has the faro bank in Cap Ayres' saloon 
Barton cursed under his breath 
After another long pause he asked How many people know who they are 
Everyone 
Your cousin Finley saw to that 
He's quite a rat you know 
He sold out to Kruger's men 
He's informed them of everything you've ever written him 
He wants your ranch 
Barton stood up 
He said tensely All right 
Let's go get the boy 
Dill had come up also 
I was afraid of this 
I almost didn't tell you 
If you hadn't I'd have killed you 
Dill's voice tightened 
But you can't ride into the Ferry 
That's what they'll expect you to do 
They'll be there waiting for you 
I understand how you feel about the child 

The hell you do 
Barton's voice was rougher than Dill had ever heard it 
I never saw him 
My wife died in childbirth after I was sent away 
I can't leave him there 
Donald Kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage and I wouldn't entrust a snake to his tender care 
I've got to get the boy 
Let's ride 
Chapter two 
Barton's men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult 
It was over an hour before their escape was discovered but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state 
It reached Donald Kruger in his massive home in Burlingame 
It reached the mines at North San Juan and Bloomfield 
It brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences 
For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg and Mitchell Barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence 
Creighton Hague sat in his office above the Ione pit 
The office was of logs four rooms each heated by an iron stove 
The building was dwarfed by the scene outside 
There a dozen giant monitors played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside 
The gravel was the bed of an ancient river buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth 
It was partially cemented by ages and pressure yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams the force of a thousand fire hoses and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices 
A million dollars' of gold a month 
A million tons of rock and soil and brush 
The monitors ran twenty-four hours each day 
Their roar like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles 
Hague like all who worked near the pits was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums 
He was a big man wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air 
Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt 
Ten years older than Mitch Barton he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation 
He was proud of his accomplishments proud of his job proud that Donald Kruger and his associates trusted him 
He lived and breathed for the mining company 
No man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless and Hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life 
There came a ghost of noise at the office door and Hague swung to see Kodyke in the entrance from the outer room 
Hague had never accustomed himself to Kodyke 
The man was tall thin with a narrow face and a too-large nose 
The eyes always held Hague eyes of a dead man lidless as a lizard's with the fixed intensity of a cobra 
Even Hague was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was Kodyke 
He knew nothing about the man's history 
Kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from Kruger 
Kodyke was to head the dread company police 
He ran the change rooms 
He threw out the hi-graders 
He supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to San Francisco 
Hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike 
He pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype 
This is Mitchell Barton 
He broke out of Folsom last night 
Apparently he bribed one of the guards 
We want him back there or we want him dead 
Kodyke took the picture in a lean hand studying it thoughtfully 
Dangerous 
Dangerous yes 
You know how the ranchers in the valley are 
They blame us for all their troubles 
Ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches 
It cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them 
We don't want Barton's Night Riders loose again 
The gunman nodded slipping the picture into his breast pocket saying nothing 
Normally Hague wasted no words but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew Kodyke was aware of all he said 
If she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother she did not comment upon it 
After they had finished eating Melissa took Sprite the kitten under her arm so that Auntie Grace can teach it about the whistle and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother 
She had offered to walk but Pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called Auntie 
When they reached their neighbor's house Pamela said a few polite words to Grace and kissed Melissa lightly on the forehead the impulse prompted by a stray thought of the type to which she was frequently subject these days that they might never see one another again 
Then she turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill with the village as her ostensible destination 
As she drove she thought about her plan 
It was really quite simple 
So simple in fact that it might even work although Pamela now in her new frame of mind was careful not to pretend too much assurance 
That mistake she thought had cost her dearly these past few days and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her 
She must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest 
When the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the Culver house Pamela turned the wheel guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house and stopped 
All of her movements were careful and methodical partaking of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime 
She locked the ignition removed the keys stepped out of the car and went into the house 
Here she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom 
On her bureau lay a small brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving an object which Pamela believed now had been the property of her great-grandfather Major Hiram Munroe Culver 
He had belonged to this land and perhaps had desecrated it and this was the only material symbol that remained of him 
If she Pamela were being held responsible for his crimes then hers must be the final act of expiation 
She would return this symbol to the mountain as one pours seed back into the soil every Spring or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice 
Slowly and thoughtfully she slipped the ornament into the pocket of her slacks moved down the stairs and out of the house 
There was only one place where the mountain might receive her that unnamed unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom 
Atonement if atonement were possible could only be made at that sacred sacrificial basin 
It was there that she would have to enact her renunciation beg forgiveness 
Perhaps it was insane Pamela thought 
Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream 
But she was caught in it and she faced the terrible possibility that if it were a dream it was one from which she might never awaken 
Facing the forest now she who had not dared to enter it before walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool 
She remembered little of her previous journey there with Grace and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it 
The forest was open and freely welcoming extending an enchanted hand 
The ground was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle 
Birds chirped and chattered in the trees and the sun all dewy-eyed and soft caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time 
It was not thought Pamela such an evil place after all 
No wonder Melissa responded so completely to its beckoning 
Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed 
Was it not possible after all that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the Culvers that she had erred in failing to understand this 
Pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along 
The slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear 
She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants 
Having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her Pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them 
A few days ago she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous 
today on the contrary it seemed utterly reasonable 
She did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail 
she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal 
If as she walked her steps fumbled from time to time she chose to ignore that omen 
If the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim she tried not to heed 
Success depended upon maintaining her equanimity 
she must be poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest 
The forest took on an impersonal aspect 
It did not care what sort of person prowled its woods plucked at its bark or stripped the berries from its bushes 
Unconcerned indifferent unmotivated the forest was simply there fighting man's depredations with more abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical evening laughter 
Red man or white man pacifist or killer the forest would accept them all knowing that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence 
knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man 
Pamela shook her head 
She must not think about time 
That was another one of those traps 
In her grim pursuit of tranquillity Pamela focused her thoughts on her husband 
If when this was all over she found the words to tell him about it she wondered if he would ever understand 
How could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent 
Indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights nor would his days be haunted by the dimly-outlined ill-conceived figure of her benighted ancestor 
His bright daylight mind would whistle away such images 
they would not dare to face his scoffing 
Pamela was glad Jim was nowhere near 
His presence would have interfered with her duty 
The mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles 
The trees huddled more closely together their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against the sun 
Bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours for the struggling stranger and without the direct light of the sun to act as compass Pamela could no longer be positive of her direction 
Nevertheless she continued to move upward 
She was sure she would reach the pool by climbing and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles 
The forest had become an alien world where she strove alone unprotected unguided to deal with whatever hindrances were offered 
It was a bold dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress eclipsing the sun and human time 
At one and the same time she was within it but still searching for the drawbridge that would give her entry 
Silence came into the forest a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees 
Silence walked at Pamela's side its presence numbingly close yet too far for her to hear 
Silence stood in front of her waiting and in back of her blocking her retreat 
She stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth 
In spite of her attempt to preserve her balance she fell bruising her arm on a naked stone 
For a moment she could not catch her breath and then her breath returning in short frightened spasms she lifted herself to her feet laboriously 
She started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes 
Her arm bled slightly and the offended skin cried out in pain 
She looked around 
She was bewildered 
She seemed to have come such a long distance too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees 
She stood quite still trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn a path to follow a clue to guide her 
She was standing in a thick grove 
The trees were crowded so closely together that their branches overlapped virtually shutting out the sun completely 
The earth smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing effect of the sun's rays 
She had the feeling that under the mouldering leaves there would be the bodies of dead animals quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain 
The thought made Pamela shudder 
A terrible chill swept through the grove 
Not a breeze exactly but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove catching Pamela in a leering embrace 
There was a peculiar density about it a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified never actually perceived 
Where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such a scene 
She already knew this unwholesome chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive 
It enclosed her clammy hands and twined around her ankles 
It crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin 
It crawled across her breasts suffocating the life in her nipples 
It circled her thighs exploring with its icy tentacles 
It entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus and its particles spreading creeping crawling joined themselves into steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached 
stifled her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps 
clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws 
She had to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain depriving her of reason and sight 
But she did not know which way to go 
The shadows of the trees engulfed her foreclosing every possible exit from the grove 
She had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles 
She could not scream for even if a sound could take shape within her parched mouth who would hear who would listen 
Does the mountain listen 
Pamela groped blindly 
She had to escape 
She had to move in some direction any direction that would take her away from this evil place 
She thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back 
Her own body protested aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed where cold demon wisps still clung and caressed 
Every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy 
Twigs cracked loudly under her feet 
bushes swished and scratched at her slacks 
tree branches snapped as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her 
Miraculously she found exactly the right statement 
She began it deliberately so that none of her words would be lost on him 
I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord 
I'm well aware that you've got a pedigree as long as my leg and that I don't amount to anything 
But 
But it don't matter a-tall Lord supplied fondly 
To me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams an' the sweetest flower that grows 
Beaming idiotically he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her 
She yanked away from him furiously 
You shut up 
Shu-tt up-pp 
I've got something to say to you and by God you're going to listen 
Do you hear me 
You're going to listen 
Lord nodded agreeably 
He said he wanted very much to listen 
He knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important as well as pleasin' to the ear and he didn't want to miss a word of it 
So would she mind speaking a little louder 
I think you stink Tom Lord 
I think you're mean and hateful and stupid and louder 
Said Joyce 
Uh-huh 
So I can hear you while I'm checkin' the car 
Looks like we might be in for a speck of trouble 
He opened the door and got out 
He waited at the car side for a moment looking down at her expectantly 
Well 
Wasn't you goin' to say somethin' 
Then helpfully as she merely stared at him in weary silence Maybe you could write it down for me huh 
Print it in real big letters an' I can cipher it out later 
Aah go on she said 
Just go the hell on 
He grinned nodded and walked around to the front of the car 
Lips pursed mournfully he stared down at its crazily sagging left side 
Then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots peered into the orderly chaos of axle shock absorber and spring 
He went prone on his stomach the better to pursue his examination 
After a time he straightened again brushing the red Permian dust from his hands slapping it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored twenty-five-dollar shirt 
He wore no gun a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country 
Never he'd once told Joyce had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun 
And he really feels that way she thought 
That's really all he's got all he is 
Just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package 
If I could make myself feel the same way 
She studied him hopefully yearningly 
against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis 
Here in the God-forsaken place the westerly end of nowhere Tom Lord looked almost insignificant almost contemptible 
He was handsome with his coal-black hair and eyes his fine-chiseled features 
But she'd known plenty of handsomer guys and conceding his good looks what was there left 
He wasn't a big man 
rather on the medium side 
Neither was he very powerful of build 
He could move very quickly she knew although he seldom found occasion to do so but he was more wiry than truly strong 
And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance 
Just nothing she told herself 
Just so darned sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone 
But by gosh I want him and I'm going to have him 
He caught her eye came back around the car with the boot-wearer 
teetering half-mincing walk 
Why did these yokels still wear boots anyway when most had scarcely sat a horse in years 
He slid in at her side tucked a cigar into his mouth and politely proffered one to her 
Oh cut it out Tom 
She snapped 
Can't you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute 
This ain't your brand maybe Lord suggested 
Or maybe you just don't feel like a cigar 
I feel like getting back to town that's what I feel like 
Now are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk 
Might get there faster walkin' Lord drawled seein' as how I got a busted front spring 
On the other hand howsomever maybe you wouldn't either 
I figger it's probl'y a sixty-five-mile walk and I c'n maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of hours 
How with what 
There's nothing out here but rattlesnakes 
Now ain't it the truth 
Lord laughed with secret amusement 
Not a danged thing but rattlesnakes so I reckon I'll get the boss rattler to help me 
Tom 
For God's sake 
Looky 
He pointed cutting her off 
See that wildcat 
She saw it then the distant derrick of the wildcat a test well in unexplored country 
And even with her limited knowledge of such things she knew that the car could be repaired there 
sufficiently at least to get them back into town 
A wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency 
He had to depend on himself since he was invariably miles and hours away from others 
Well let's get going she said impatiently 
I She broke off frowning 
What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag 
Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you 
Why I meant what I said Lord declared 
What else would I mean anyways 
She looked at him lips compressed 
Then with a shrug of pretended indifference she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her make-up 
In his mood it was the best way to handle him 
that is to show no curiosity whatsoever 
Otherwise she would be baited into a tantrum teased and provoked until she lost control of herself and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom Lord Vs. Joyce Lakewood 
The car lurched along at a snail's crawl the left-front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire occasionally scraping against the road itself 
Lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel 
He seemed very pleased with himself as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned 
Along with this self-satisfaction however Joyce sensed a growing tension 
It poured out of him like an electric current a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action and that that action would be all that he anticipated 
Joyce had seen him like this once before more than once actually but on one particularly memorable occasion 
That was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride field boss for the Highlands Oil Gas Company 
Tom had been laying for Aaron McBride for a long time just waiting to catch him out of line 
McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip 
He had a legitimate reason for wearing it 
It was payday for Highlands and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields 
Moreover as long as the weapon was carried openly the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of it 
So what's this all about 
He demanded when Lord confronted him 
I'm not the only man in town with a gun or the only one without a permit 
It was the wrong thing to say 
By failing to do as he was told instantly to take out a permit or return the gun to his car he had played into Lord's hands 
The trouble was that he had virtually had to protest 
The deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him 
So How about it 
He said 
Why single me out on this permit deal 
Well I'll tell you about that Lord told him 
We aim t' be see-lective y'know 
Don't like to bother no one unless we have to which I figger we do in your case 
Figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands big shots 
McBride reddened 
He himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company but that had nothing to do with him 
He was an honest man doing a hard job and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable 
Look Lord he said hoarsely 
I know you've got a grudge against me and maybe I can't blame you 
You think that Highlands swindled you and I helped 'em do it 
But you're all wrong man 
I'm no lawyer 
I just do what I'm told and 
uh-huh 
An' that could mean trouble with a fella that's workin' for crooks 
So you get rid of that pistol right now Mis-ter McBride 
You do that or take you out a permit right now 
McBride couldn't do either of course 
Not immediately as the deputy demanded 
Not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes 
To do so would make his job well-nigh impossible 
Oil-field workers were a rough-tough lot 
How could he exert authority over them make them toe the line as he had to if he knuckled under to this small-town clown 
I'll get around to it a little later he mumbled desperately 
Just as soon as I go to the bank and 
huh-uh 
Now Mis-ter McBride said Lord and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss's arm 
It was strictly the deputy's game but McBride had gone too far to throw in 
Now he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's coldest deck 
He flung off Lord's hand and attempted to push past him inadvertently shoving him into a storefront 
It was practically the last move that McBride made of his own volition 
Lord slugged him in the stomach so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine 
Then as he doubled gasping vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten Lord straightened him with an uppercut 
A rabbit punch redoubled him 
And then there was a numbing blow to the heart and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach 
But he couldn't keep up with them 
No more could he defend himself against them 
He seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen 
And he could no longer think of face-saving of honor but only of escape 
Why he's going to kill me he thought wildly 
I meant him no harm 
I've given willful hurt to no man 
I was just doing my job just following orders and for that he's going to kill me 
Beat me to death in front of a hundred people 
Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it the murder would go unpunished 
He McBride would be cited as in the wrong and he Lord would go scot-free an officer who had only done his duty though perhaps too energetically 
McBride staggered into the street flopped sprawling in the stinging dust 
Fear-maddened fleeing the lengthening shadow of death he scrambled to his feet again 
He couldn't see 
he was long past the point of coherent thinking 
Dimly he heard laughter hoots of derision but he could not read the racket properly 
He could not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air 
He hated them too much to understand the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that was Lord's world 
This he was sure was the way they would act 
laughing at a dying man laughing as a man was beaten to death 
And nothing would be done about it 
Nothing unless 
Donna 
Donna his young wife the girl who was both daughter and wife to him 
Donna was like he was 
She lived by the rules never compromising never blinded or diverted by circumstance 
And Donna would 
When he regained consciousness he was in Lord's house in the office of Doctor Lord the deputy's deceased father 
The Brannon outfit known as the Slash-B because of its brand reached Hondo Creek before sundown 
The herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's bedground 
Two of the new hands a Mexican named Jose Amado and a kid known only as Laredo were picked for the first trick of riding night herd 
The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda 
They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie's fire rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes lounged about 
There was some idle talk a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day's drive 
But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious the failure of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit 
It especially bothered the older hands 
The cook Mateo Garcia had arrived there long before the herd 
He'd started a fire and put coffee on and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon 
He was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the Dutch oven 
Supper would be ready within the hour 
The Maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby 
Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon's and his father's wagon 
Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire and his wife was busy at it now 
Conchita kept an eye on the twins and little Elena trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing 
Conchita nagged at the younger children attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon 
Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the Maguires joined it which had been at midday 
He'd come alone without his wife and child 
He'd been in an angry mood Conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him 
She wondered what had taken place in town between him and his wife 
She wished that she could talk to her mother about it 
Not that her mother knew what had happened but they could speculate upon it 
But her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it and say that it was none of her concern 
Pat get out of that creek 
You too Sean 
Elena you'll get mud all over your dress 
Even as she called to the children Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon 
Tomas she called him as the Mexican hands did 
He was in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero Luis Hernandez 
Whatever they are talking about 
Conchita wondered 
It bothered her that she probably would never know 
Certainly she wouldn't dare ask her father afterward 
He would tell her not to pry into grownups' affairs as though she were a little kid like Elena 
At the moment the three men were not saying much of anything 
They were sitting on their heels rider-fashion over by the still empty calf wagon 
Brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel with the other two facing him 
He held a cigarette in his right hand 
It was burning away forgotten 
His face was clouded with unhappiness 
He'd told Hank Maguire and Luis Hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do 
They were considering it gravely neither seeming to like what he planned 
Finally Hernandez said I could offer you advice Tomas but you wouldn't heed it 
Let's hear it anyway 
Wait a little while 
Let Senora Brannon live in her father's house for a time 
Give her time to miss you 
Maybe she will then come to you 
After all you want the senora as much as you want the boy 
You need her even more than you need him 
She won't change her mind Brannon said 
John Clayton will see to that 
But after a time away from you 

A year Luis 
Five 
Ten 
How long should I wait 
Maybe in a year Tomas 

In a year she'll like living in Clayton's house too much to come back to me Brannon said flatly 
And the boy will be too much under his influence by then 
I've got to take Danny away from Clayton before I lose him altogether 
Hell in a year or five or ten the boy will have forgotten me his own father 
But to take him and leave his mother behind is not good 
In my place you'd follow such advice as you give me 
Hernandez looked suddenly uncertain 
That I can't answer for I can't imagine something like this happening to me 
Maybe I should withdraw my advice no 
Brannon looked at Hank Maguire 
And you 
What would you do in my place 
Hank shook his head 
I don't know Tom 
Like Luis I can't see something like this happening to me 
With Maria and me there's never any problem 
Where I go she goes and the kids with us 
You're going to need your woman 
And the boy will need his mother 
If you take the one you'd better take both 
Brannon shook his head 
I won't force Beth to come against her will 
But I'm going to have my son 
They were silent for a little while each looking glum 
Finally Luis Hernandez said What must be must be 
I am with you of course Tomas 
And Hank Maguire added So am I Tom 
All right Brannon said rising 
We'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck 
Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall 
They had for cover both darkness and a summer storm 
During much of the fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east 
Later they'd heard the rumble of thunder and then just outside Rockfork they ran into rain 
Those who had slickers donned them 
The others put on old coats or ducking jackets whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles 
There were seven of them enough for a show of strength to run a bluff 
It was to be nothing more than that 
There was to be no gunplay 
If the bluff failed and they ran into trouble Brannon had told the others they would withdraw and he would come after his son another time 
He didn't want to put himself outside the law 
With him were Hank Maguire Luis Hernandez and Luis's son Pedro 
The Ramirez brothers were also along 
The seventh man was Red Hogan a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising 
They were all good men 
It was dark early because of the storm 
Also because of the storm the streets of Rockfork were deserted 
Lighted windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour 
They reined in before the town marshal's office a box-sized building on Main Street 
A lamp burned inside but Brannon peering through the window saw that the office was empty 
He'd hoped to catch Jesse Macklin there 
Probably just stepped out he said 
Maybe to have supper 
Red come along 
The rest of you wait here 
With Red Hogan he rode to the Welcome Cafe 
Hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside 
Not there he said getting back onto his horse 
Maybe he's at the hotel 
They rode to the Rockfork House a little farther along the opposite side of the street 
They reined in there Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan went to look for Jesse Macklin in the hotel dining room 
Brannon had no slicker 
He'd put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked 
But he felt no physical discomfort 
He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain 
He hardly noticed the blue-green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder 
Hogan reappeared stopped on the hotel porch lifted a hand in signal 
Brannon dismounted and climbed the steps 
He's finished eating Hogan said 
Sitting with a cup of coffee now 
It shouldn't be long 
It seemed long at least to Tom Brannon 
He and Hogan waited by the door one to either side 
Macklin was the third man to come out and he came unhurriedly 
He was puffing on a cigar and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain 
It was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them and then it was too late 
They closed in fast kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun 
Just come along Brannon told him 
Don't start anything you can't finish 
Now listen Macklin began 
We'll talk over at your office 
Brannon I warn you 
Let's go Marshal Brannon said and took him by the arm 
Hogan gripped the lawman's other arm 
They escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office 
The other five Slash-B men followed them inside crowding the small room 
His face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms 
He looked at each of them in turn Brannon last of all 
I'll remember you he said 
Every last one of you 
As for you Brannon 
Put your gun on the desk Marshal 
Now hold on damn it 
I won't 
Red Hogan's patience ran out 
He lifted the skirt of Macklin's coat took his gun from its holster tossed it onto the desk 
Too much fooling around he said 
Don't press your luck badge-toter 
Brannon said Now the key to the lockup Marshal 
Key 
Macklin said 
What for 
Can't you guess 
Brannon said 
We're putting you where you won't come to harm 
Come on the key 
Get it out 
Damned if I will 
Brannon you've assaulted a law officer and 
They moved in on him crowded him from all sides 
No man laid a hand on him but the threat of violence was there 
His face took on a sudden pallor became beaded with sweat and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing 
He held out a moment longer then his nerve gave under the pressure 
He swore and said All right 
It's here in my pocket 
Get it out Brannon ordered 
Then as Macklin obeyed Now let's go out back 
Resignedly Macklin turned to the back door 
They followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear 
The door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron 
It was secured by an oversized padlock 
Macklin balked again not wanting to unlock and open the door 
They crowded him in that threatening way once more forced him to give in 
Once the door was open they crowded him inside the dark building 
He was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door 
They returned to the street mounted their horses rode through the rain to the big house on Houston Street 
Its windows glowed with lamplight 
Deputy Marshal Luke Harper still stood guard on the veranda a forlorn scarecrowish figure in the murky dark 
He came to the edge of the veranda peered down at them with his hand on his gun 
Don't try it Brannon told him dismounting and starting up the steps with his men following 
Don't get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you 
He strode past the now frightened man entered the house 
Miguel and Arturo Ramirez remained on the veranda to keep Harper from interfering 
The others followed Brannon inside 
They trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor four roughly garbed and tough-looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house 
They brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves that of their own sweat of campfire smoke of horses and cattle 
They tracked mud on the oaken floor on the carpet 
Their presence fouled the elegance of that room 
And their arrival caught John Clayton and Charles Ansley off guard 
The author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing 
For men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second 
But the day of the deadline came and passed and the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction 
For with a single exception nothing had happened to them 
The exception was an Iron Mountain settler named William Lewis 
After walking out to his corral that morning he'd been amazed to see the dust puff up in front of his feet 
A split second later the distant crack of a rifle had sounded 
He'd mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the shot had come 
But he had found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted 
There had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near 
Lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing 
He hadn't even pretended to be farming his spread 
His land had never been plowed 
He had done his rustling openly and boasted about it 
He had received both first and second anonymous notices and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them 
He had cursed at them and threatened them 
He was a man those neighbors testified later who didn't have a friend in the world 
William Lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet and once more he accused and threatened everyone 
I'll be ready next time 
He raged 
I'll be shootin' right back 
He had his chance the very next morning for exactly the same thing happened again 
This time Lewis had his own rifle in his hands and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot then spent most of the day searching out the area 
He found nothing but he still refused to give up and move out 
Just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face 
He exploded 
That's all I ask 
He never got that chance 
For the unseen ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time 
A bullet smashed directly into the center of William Lewis' chest 
He slumped against a log fence rail then tried to lift himself 
Two more shots followed in quick succession dropping him limp and huddled on the ground 
An inquest was held and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards 
Rumors of the offer Tom Horn had made at the Stockgrowers' Association meeting had leaked out by then and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got underway the prosecuting attorney a Colonel Baird ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning 
It took some time to locate Horn 
He was finally found in the Bates Hole region of Natrona County two counties away 
Prosecutor Baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment 
But that indictment was never made 
For Tom Horn it turned out had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in Bates Hole the day of the killing 
The former scout's alibi couldn't be shaken 
The authorities had to release him 
He immediately rode on to Cheyenne threw a ten-day drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends 
Dead center at three hundred yards that coroner said 
He'd grin 
Three shots in that fella 'fore he hit the ground 
You reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that 
Publicly he denied everything 
Privately he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin 
For a blood-chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd promised to do 
Tom Horn was soon back at work giving his secret employers their money's worth 
A good many beef-hungry settlers were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats 
The company herds were being raided less often and cabins and soddies all over the range were standing deserted 
But there were other homesteaders who passed the Lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing the work of one of his neighbors 
The rustling problem was by no means solved 
Even in the very area where the shooting had been done cattle were still disappearing 
For less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on a blatant and defiant rustler named Fred Powell 
Fred was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle his own hired man Andy Ross mentioned later 
Everyone knew it but he sort of acted like he didn't care who knew it even after them notes came even after he'd heard about Lewis even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times hisself 
On the morning of September 10 1895 Powell and Ross rose at dawn and began their day's work 
Haying time was close at hand and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack 
Harnessing a team to a buckboard they drove out to a willow-lined creek about a half-mile off then climbed down and began chopping 
Andy Ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded 
He looked around in surprise then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest 
The hired man ran over to help his boss 
My God I'm shot 
Powell gasped 
And he collapsed and died instantly 
Ross had no intention of searching for the assassin 
He heaved the dead man onto the buckboard yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast 
But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing 
A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman's hiding place 
There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots 
Not even an empty cartridge case could be found 
Once again Tom Horn was the first and most likely suspect and he was brought in for questioning immediately 
Once again he shook his head kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm and had a strongly supported alibi ready 
Later riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of Cheyenne he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made 
Exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business proposition with me he'd blandly announce 
And I sort o' got a corner on the market 
Tom a friend asked him once how come you bushwhacked them rustlers 
They wouldn't o' stood no chance with you in a plain straight-out shoot-down 
He had lots of friends then as always 
Even as he became widely known as a professional killer nearly every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend 
No man's name brought more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo 
Well he explained s'posin' you was a nester swingin' the long rope 
Which would you be most scairt of a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down 
Yeah I can see that the friend was forced to agree 
But well it just don't seem sportin' somehow 
Sportin' 
The tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared in amazement 
Sportin' 
He echoed again in soft wonder 
I seen a lot o' things in my time 
I found a trooper once the Apache had spread-eagled on an ant hill and another time we ran across some teamsters they'd caught tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o' their skulls 
I heard o' Texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink 'em and squeeze him to death 
But there's one thing I never seen or heard of one thing I just don't think there is and that's a sportin' way o' killin' a man 
After the first two murders the warning notes were rarely ignored 
The lesson had been learned 
The examples were plain 
When Fred Powell's brother-in-law Charlie Keane moved into the dead man's home the anonymous letter writer took no chances on Charlie taking up where Fred had left off and wasted no time on a first notice 
If you don't leave this country within 3 days your life will be taken the same as Powell's was 
This was the message found tacked to the cabin door 
Keane left within three days 
All through Albany and Laramie counties other men were doing the same 
Houses of settlers who'd treated the company herds as a natural resource free for the taking were sitting empty with weeds growing high in their yards 
The small half-heartedly tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow 
No cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer 
Jury judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere at any time to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated 
For three straight years Tom Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming pastures and how many men he killed after Lewis and Powell if he killed Lewis and Powell will never be known 
It is possible although highly doubtful that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state 
It is also possible but equally doubtful that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him 
For that legend was growing explosively Rumor was insisting he received a price of $600 a man 
The best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $125 very good money in an era when top hands worked for $30 and found 
Rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark 
A detailed search of old coroner's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest 

One thing was certain his method was effective so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary 
The mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the Upper Laramie country in a single week 
My reputation's my stock in trade Tom mentioned more than once 
He evidently couldn't foresee that it might be his downfall in the end 
He had made himself the personification of the Devil to the homesteaders 
But to the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure 
Such ranchers as Coble and Clay and the Bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown 
He made their spreads his headquarters and he helped out in their roundups 
In the cow camps Tom Horn was regarded as a hero as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos 
The hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threatening a beloved way of life 
The wailing guitar-strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him 
By 1898 rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in Wyoming 
When several minutes had passed and Curt hadn't emerged from the livery stable Brenner reentered the hotel and faced Summers across the counter 
I have a little job for you Charlie 
I'm sure you won't mind doing me a small favor 
Brenner's voice was oily but Summers wasn't fooled 
He moistened his lips uneasily 
What is it you want me to do Mr. Brenner 
Brenner shrugged carelessly 
It's very simple 
I just want you to take a message to Diane Molinari 
Tell her to come here to the hotel 
Vastly relieved Summers nodded and started toward the door 
One thing Summers Brenner said 
You're not to mention my name 
Tell her Curt Adams wants to see her 
Summers pulled up short and turned around 
I don't know Mr. Brenner he said haltingly beginning to get an inkling of Brenner's plans 
It doesn't seem quite right telling her a thing like that 
Couldn't I just His voice trailed off into silence 
Brenner continued to smile but his eyes were cold 
He turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed 
You know Summers he said thoughtfully 
Eagle's Nest ought to have a fire company 
If someone were to drop a match in here this place would go up like a haystack 
He started toward the stairway then turned to add Tell her to come to Adams's room that Adams is in trouble 
Tell her to hurry 
Yes sir 
His face pale Summers headed for the street 
Curt's visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching 
He paused only long enough to ascertain that Jess's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside 
The fact that Jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that Diane's information had been wrong but Curt didn't interpret it this way 
A man like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed 
Probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding 
From the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black's house without using the street 
Curt approached the place cautiously and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees 
There was a light in Black's front room but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior 
Curt circled the house and located a barn out back 
He could hear horses moving around inside and nothing else 
There was no lock on the door only an iron hook which he unfastened 
He opened the door and went in pulling it shut behind him 
Again he stood in the darkness listening but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor 
He moved ahead carefully his left hand in front of him and came to a wooden partition 
Horse smell was very strong and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws 
He found a match in his pocket and lit it 
There were two horses in the barn a sway-backed dun and Jess Crouch's buckskin 
Curt snuffed out the match 
It was certain now that Jess was in the house but also presumably was Stacey Black 
Curt wanted to get Jess alone without interference from anyone even as spineless a person as the store owner 
He studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved 
Reaching across the side of the stall he slapped the buckskin on the rump 
The startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall 
As Curt had hoped the house door banged open 
He slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly its hoofs rattling the side of the stall 
Curt moved over beside the door and waited 
Presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard and Jess's smothered curses 
The door swung open and Jess said sourly What the hell's the matter with you 

The horse continued to snort 
Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance in its owner's voice 
Jess cursed again and entered the barn 
A match flared and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop 
As he crossed to the side of the stall Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer 
Before you try anything he said 
Remember what happened to Gruller 
Jess caught his breath in surprise 
He started to reach for his gun but apparently thought better of it 
That's the stuff Curt said 
Just hold it that way 
He reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt 
You and I have a little talking to do Jess 
You won't be needing this 
He moved up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster 
Damn you Adams Jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock 
We ain't got nothing to talk about 
If I don't come back in the house Breed's going to 
Your trigger-happy brother isn't in the house 
About now he's probably having supper 
That long ride the four of you took must've given him a good appetite 
Now turn around so I can see your face 
Jess turned 
There was raw fury in his eyes and the veins of his neck were swollen 
You're about as dumb as they come Adams 
I don't know what you're up to but when Brenner 
You can forget about Brenner too Curt said 
It's Ben Arbuckle we're going to talk about 
Arbuckle 
Jess stiffened 
I don't know nothin' about him 
No 
I suppose you don't know anything about a piece of two-by-four either 
one with blood all over it Arbuckle's blood 
Curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun 
So help me Crouch I'd like to kill you where you stand but before I do I'm going to hear you admit killing him 
Now start talking 
Who told you to do it 
Was it Dutch Brenner 
Curt was holding Jess's gun in his left hand 
He drew back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across Jess's face but didn't finish the motion 
Pistol-whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like Jess but Curt couldn't bring himself to do it 
Apparently sensing this and realizing that it gave him an advantage Jess became bold 
Having all the guns makes you a big man don't it Adams 
If we was both armed you wouldn't talk so tough 
No 
Curt reached out and dropped Jess's pistol back into the holster 
He retreated a step and holstered his own 
All right Crouch 
we're on even terms 
Now draw 
Sweat bubbled out on Jess's swarthy face 
The fingers of his right hand twisted into a claw but he didn't reach for the gun 
Curt angry enough to be a little reckless raised his hands shoulder high 
Does this make it any easier coward 
I ain't drawin' against you Jess said thickly 
I heard how you outdrew Chico 
I ain't a gunslinger 
No 
You're the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind and hits him with a club 
I just wanted to hear you say so 
Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides 
He had found Curt's weakness or what to Jess was a weakness and was smart enough to take advantage of it 
Somewhere in the distance a woman screamed 
Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention 
He had to make Jess talk and he had to do it before Stacey Black got curious and came to investigate 
Once more he lifted Jess's gun from its holster only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin 
He dropped his own beside it 
We'll do it another way then he said harshly 
Jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curt's fist 
With a roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack 
Curt managed to duck beneath the man's flailing fist and drove home a solid left to Jess's mid-section 
It was like hitting a sack of salt 
Pain shot up Curt's arm clear to the shoulder but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit 
He slammed into the wall bounced back and caught Curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning 
An inch lower and it would have knocked him out 
As it was his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move 
When his eyes began to focus he saw Jess charging at him with a pitchfork 
Curt twisted to one side and the tines of the fork bit into the floor 
Jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose 
It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet 
The tines broke off under Jess's twisting and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains out 
His aim was hurried 
so the pitchfork whistled over Curt's head 
By now Curt was seeing clearly again 
He stepped inside Jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly putting everything he had behind them 
They made Jess double over 
When his head came down Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall 
The building shook setting the lantern to swaying and the buckskin to pitching again 
Even Black's old crowbait began to snort and from the house Black yelled Jess 
What's going on out there 
Jess didn't seem too sure himself 
He lurched drunkenly to his feet lowered his head and took one step away from the wall 
Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor 
Jess had had enough 
Blood gushed from his nose and he backed off as rapidly as he could stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curt's fists 
Curt was in almost as bad shape but he wouldn't quit 
He backed Jess into a corner grabbed a handful of the man's shirtfront and drew back his right fist 
Tell me about Arbuckle 
You killed him didn't you 
It was Brenner's idea Jess mumbled dabbing at his nose 
He found out about you and Arbuckle talking 
He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble 
You mean anyone who stood up for his rights Curt said 
He let go of the shirt and Jess slumped to the floor 
Turning his back Curt crossed to the stall reached over to untie the buckskin's halter rope and waved his hand in the animal's face 
The buckskin bolted out of the stall 
Curt moved in and picked up his gun 
He shook loose straw out of the action and placed the gun in his holster 
Leaving Jess's where it lay he left the stall 
Get up Crouch 
We're going someplace 
Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door 
Who's in there 
Black called fearfully 
Curt opened the door grabbed Black by the shoulder and pulled him into the barn 
You're staying right here for a while 
This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle 
I'm going to let him tell it to somebody else 
He shoved Black toward the stall and pointed his pistol at Jess 
Get out of here 
You're coming along peacefully or I'll put a bullet in your leg 
Jess stumbled through the door 
Curt followed reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it 
Black would have little trouble getting out but it might delay him a few minutes 
Where're you takin' me 
Jess asked worriedly 
We're going to Marshal Woods's house 
Maybe if the marshal hears this himself it'll make a difference 
Somebody in this town must still have some backbone 
Over his shoulder he could see Max's loose grin and the Burnsides' glowering faces 
Honey he whispered 
Soon as we send them on their way and make camp let's you and me go for a walk down by the Snake all by ourselves 
Sally admonished her mother you've got all evening to visit with Dan 
His wounds need dressing now 
Mrs. Jackson's words recalled Dan to his lack of fitness for courting 
What a spectacle he was caked with dirt and sweat and blood filthy as a pig and naked as an Indian kissing the finest the sweetest the bravest and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world 
He released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap 
Got a lot to tend to but I'll get back quick as I can he assured her 
Dan could hear Clayton Burnside and Eben Jackson summing up their final reckoning for rental on the oxen 
Jackson was doing most of the talking 
So long as Sally's pa was coming out best on the haggle Dan didn't feel the need of putting in his two-bits' worth 
Soon as the Burnsides moved on he'd lead Rex down by the river 
there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening 
Damn it he thought bitterly picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve 
If I hadn't got Nate stopped when I did my duds'd all be shot plumb to hell 
He stooped picked up his ruined hat and pursed his lips thoughtfully 
From the way the wound in his head was itching Dan knew that it would heal 
But his only hat was something else again 
Nate 
Nate 
He shouted 
The Burnsides now ready to roll were purposefully deaf to his cry 
Nate 
He bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him 
I ain't going to fight you no more 
Nate turned his head attempting to speak in a soothing voice 
I know you ain't 
Dan affirmed feeling ten feet tall 
He moved in close jerked the handsome broad-brimmed beaver hat from Nate's head and clamped it on his own 
Here's a present for you he said shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over Nate's purpling forehead 
Me and you's trading hats so's you'll have something permanent to remember me by 
Sally left her choring to stand beside Dan 
Slipping her hand in his they silently watched the Burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight 
Much as they had to look forward to they didn't begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go 
At first Matilda could not believe her own eyes 
She had spent too many hours looking ahead hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness 
And now she could see him looking uncommon handsome standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon 
Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them Matilda could not speak at all 
Then with a glory that almost wiped out the deep downward sags in her careworn face Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon Pa 
Pa 
I can see Dan 
And he's with the Jacksons 
What about Burnsides 
Hez asked who still believed they'd have them to lick 
They ain't even in sight 
She replied 
By then Hez could see for himself and so could the others 
Soon they were all shouting greetings exchanging smiles and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again 
But even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day 
Nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle tended the cattle tethered the horses gathered fuel carried water and started their cooking fires 
Then and only then with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news 
No sooner did they hear of Dan's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action 
The wound in his scalp was examined pronounced healing and well doctored with simples before they dished up the victuals 
From then on in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood the whole group settled down to relish their food 
Even Sally in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome followed the old taboo of quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag 
After their supper the evening turned into a regular Hoe-Down 
Only they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the Virginia Reels and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration 
But with Bill O'Connor on the fiddle and Gran Harrow exuberantly shouting Glory Be and Hallelujah above their united chant of the lilting old ballads they played their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration 
Golly Rod exclaimed to Harmony as he dutifully stood by her side among the ringed spectators don't that fiddle make you wish the Bible didn't say us Baptists can't dance 
Nor Methodists neither she replied 
Not that it matters to me being this far along 
Rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied 
Come spring you'll be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too gal 
At these words of sympathy and understanding Harmony said generously I don't mind setting here along with Gran while you go out and join in the games 
Rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply I ain't much of a hand for Dare-Base and Farmer-in-the-Dell but I'd sure like to get in on the handhold and wrestles 
He looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers 
Don't reckon there's nobody out there 'cept maybe Dan who can outgrip me Harmony 
With Rod on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs. Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff Harmony settled on the edge of the grub box to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs and worried about all that might have happened to Sally 
And she was deeply thankful that she could see her now out there in the midst of a gay youthful circle skipping and singing Farmer in the dell Farmer in the dell Heigh-ho the dairy-oh the farmer in the dell 
At the sight of Sally's happy face and carefree expression Harmony's dark brooding eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears 
She was glad completely and unselfishly glad to see that things were working out the right way for both Sally and Dan 
And she really tried to go a step further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were for her and for Rod 
But she couldn't not yet 
Not with the memory of her folks and the lost Conestoga still holding her close 
Out in the center of the circle the farmer who was Dan wasted no time when they came to the line The farmer choose his wife 
With a swift swoop of his big arms he grabbed Sally out of the circle surrounding him and then kissed her soundly before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their outfit 
Soon the child the dog the cat and even the cheese all joined them out there in the circle 
By now Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them 
No matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey each one exerted its own appeal 
Even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness 
Already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains 
Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them 
No sooner were they through and the guards posted than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep 
For Matilda it was the first she had known in many a night 
Even the knowledge that she was losing another boy as a mother always does when a marriage is made did not prevent her from having the first carefree dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into Bear Valley way way back there when they were crossing those other mountains 
Next morning they moved on again 
My souls' a-gracious 
Gran Harrow exclaimed watching their rippling muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up into the load 
A body would swear I floated right up here on a cloud 
Rod and Dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins 
Shucks Gran they said almost in unison 
That wasn't nothing at all 
Leaning forward in her chair Gran nearsightedly scrutinized Dan's face 
How's Sally like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising 
Quit ragging him Gran Rod protested 
I ain't ragging him 
Gran peered again at the week-old blond mustache shadowing Dan's upper lip 
But honest-to-Betsy I've seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon 
The two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed Gran her cold snack and water jug placed the chamber pot beside her feet and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with Alice 
Rheumatics worse Pa 
Dan asked Hez who had limped back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends 
My right leg's stiff as a board this morning he replied 
But the sun'll fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling 
The three men stepped out to the side to wait for Captain Clemens' signal 
Hez looked up at the high face of Emigrant Rock official signboard for the Raft River turnoff and gloated Seems funny that them Burnsides never took time to leave their John-Henry up thar 
Wonder what made them hurry so Rod drawled giving Dan a sly wink 
Dan grinned and changed the subject 
From now on Sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and Rod's outfit 
Ain't no sense you eating our dust Rod protested 
Sally and her ma want to trade off on account of Harmony being so far along Dan explained 
Jackson recruited his critters and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up 
He's got the tightest running gear in the train now 
Besides 'tain't no more'n right for me to follow with my black oxen so's I can unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch 
Captain Clemens' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams 
Reckon ye're right Dan Hez called back over his shoulder 
I'll shore be needing ye both on the pull out o' the canyon 
Rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing precipice-walled gorge 
We'll double teams zigzagging up the mountain Harmony he spoke reassuringly concerned by the pinched look around her mouth 
Like enough we'll all be up on top by sundown 
Out of the corner of his eye he could see his father's wheels beginning to turn 
Before Harmony had a chance to reply Rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen's backs 
While no larger than Dutch Springs this mining supply town had the appearance of being far busier and more prosperous 
Men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about 
Although they were forced to maintain a sharper watch this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid them 
Gyp'll be holdin' forth in some bar if he's here at all Cobb declared glancing along the street as they stretched their legs 
There were no less than six or seven saloons in Ganado not counting the lower class dives all vying for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters 
Pat only nodded 
Take one side of the street and I'll take the other he proposed 
If you spot Carmer give a yell before you move in 
Cobb's assent was tight 
You do the same 
It's all I ask Stevens 
Separating they took different sides of the main drag and systematically combed the bars 
Russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero 
Suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer so casually even were he to prove the thief 
He tramped out of the Miners Rest with his hopes plummeting and headed doggedly for the Palace Saloon the last place of any consequence on this side of the street 
The Palace was an elaborate establishment built practically on stilts in front with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch 
Behind its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest to the rocky ribs of the canyonside 
Russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch 
The front windows of the place were long and narrow reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of the interior 
Heading for the batwings Cobb glanced perfunctorily through the nearest window and suddenly dodged aside 
Nerves tight as a bowstring he paused to gather his wits 
Against all expectation Carmer was inside clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him 
Fierce anger surged through Russ 
He fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot 
Reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows he feverishly scanned the busy street below 
Stevens was nowhere in sight 
Muffling an exclamation Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down 
As luck had it he had not gone twenty feet in the street before Pat appeared 
What luck Cobb 
He said swiftly 
Russ pointed upward 
He's there he got out tersely curbing his rising excitement 
Hitching his cartridge belt around Pat glanced upward briefly at the Palace and started that way with Cobb at his side 
Climbing the steps steadily they reached the top and headed for the door 
Pat pushed through first 
Forced behind him momentarily Russ followed at once and halted two steps inside 
His eyes widened 
While five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry with Gyp Carmer a prominent figure it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday 
Carmer himself was nowhere to be seen 
A man knocked the roulette ball about idly in its track and another dozed at one of the card tables 
Two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar while the sleek-headed bartender absently polished a glass 
Looking the setup over Stevens started coolly for the rear of the place 
Where yuh goin' 
It was the barkeep 
Halting Pat turned to survey him deliberately 
He did not reply going on toward the back 
Less assured than the tall wide-shouldered man in the lead Cobb followed alertly a hand on his gun butt 
The bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it 
He said no more 
A hall opened in back of the bar running toward an ell 
Pat moved into it 
Small rooms probably for cards opened off on either side 
All the doors were open at this hour except one and it was toward this that Stevens made his way with Russ close at his shoulder 
The door was locked 
A single kick made it spring open shuddering 
Pat saw Gyp Carmer staggering forward a half-filled bottle upraised as if to strike 
Russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside 
With a bellow Carmer lunged at him 
But he was more than half-drunk and his faculties were dulled 
Cobb unleashed a single powerful jab that sent Gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan 
He started to struggle up heaving desperately 
Russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach 
Kneeling Cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back holding him pinned 
Okay Stevens 
I've drawn his fangs he snapped 
Go through his pockets will you 
If we have to we'll take him apart and see what he's made of 
Complying methodically Pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing 
Cobb watched this with hunted eyes his desperate hope waning by the moment 
Stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when Russ abruptly rose and lunged toward Carmer's hat which had tumbled half-a-dozen feet away when he first fell 
Cobb got it 
Straightening up his eyes ablaze he held out the battered Stetson 
Look at this 
Inside the crown stuffed behind the stained sweatband could be seen thin crumpled wads of currency 
Carmer's ingenious cache for his loot had been found 
By golly Stevens 
You were right Russ exclaimed tearing the loose bills out of Carmer's hat 
That is if we can be sure this is Colcord's money 
Pat grunted 
Where else would he get it 
Count what you've got there Cobb 
We can soon tell 
Russ ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come by honestly 
Pat nodded 
It's within a hundred of what Crip had he declared 
We know Penny spent some and Carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on 
Handing the money over Russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs as if ridding himself of something unclean 
His glance at Gyp Carmer was disdainful 
Shall we get out of here 
Leaving the card room they moved back through the Palace the way they had come 
Glowering looks met them in the bar but there was no attempt to halt them 
Pausing in the outside door to glance behind him Pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out 
He and Cobb clattered down the high steps to the street 
Neither spoke till they reached their horses 
Pat paused there looking across at the young fellow 
It'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to Colcord and tell him about it Russ 
He started to return it 
To his faint surprise Russ held up his hand 
Not me he ruled decidedly 
I've had enough 
It was you that tracked it down anyway Stevens he pursued strictly 
I'll shove along home 
Whatever you say 
Pat swung into the saddle yet still he delayed his brows puckered 
You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you really he observed mildly 
Old Crip wasn't retorted Cobb tartly 
He'll know when you tell him 
But I want this to sink in awhile 
Then maybe next time he won't be so quick on the trigger 
Pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs 
You're the doctor he returned with a smile 
But I still think Penny's an awful nice girl Russ 
You don't have to tell me flashed Cobb 
Giving the other a dark look he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street 
Pat let him go following more leisurely 
At the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner and as a consequence did not see Cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for Antler 
The truth was the puncher was both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck 
Penny's always glad to see me over there he mused bleakly 
Yet had he not visited the girl at Saw Buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle 
Over and above that however was his growing suspicion of Chuck Stober's part in recent events 
Gyp Carmer couldn't have known about Colcord's money unless he was told and who else would have told him 
He asked himself 
It's the second time War Ax hands made a play for that money 
How much of an accident could that be 
Nearing home he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun 
In town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot 
but on the range gunfire had a meaning 
Hauling up Russ listened carefully 
Two minutes later it came again a double explosion followed by a third sounding more distant 
As near as Cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the Antler ranch house 
He tightened up in a twinkling 
So far as he knew only his father could be there 
What did it mean 
Clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter with growing alarm 
His first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing 
Still a quarter-mile away the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed 
Setting a course straight for the house he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his face 
When it was followed by a second whining even closer Cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression 
He knew now what he was up against 
Whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging the Antler house and having spotted his approach was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight 
Cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot Russ drew his Colt and examined it briefly 
If he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested he had his answer a moment later 
Over this way 
He ain't gone far 
A harsh cry floated to him across the brush 
A carbine cracked more loudly and a slug clipped fragments from the brush off at one side 
The would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close 
Dismounting Russ looked about hastily 
Toward the west this depression led toward a draw 
Leading his pony he hurried that way not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range 
Swinging up then and bending forward over the horn he urged his mount down the meandering draw 
He had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind 
He had been sighted and his attacker pumping shot after shot 
A shot or two went wild before Cobb felt something tug at his foot 
A slug had torn half of his stirrup-guard away 
A second twitched his shirtsleeve and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm 
Another snarled close overhead 
Jumping Jerusalem 
Let's get out of here 
At the first shot Russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw 
The long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless 
Sweeping a look around he saw that he was safe for the moment 
He heard cries from behind him but he could make out no words 
He dashed madly for the next elbow turn in the draw and made it 
Recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw he plunged forward with undiminished speed 
Gradually the wash climbed upward forcing him toward open range 
Yet he must chance it 
He clambered out of the dwindling wash the loose dirt flying behind him and flashed a look about 
Early in November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions 
And Sweeney Squadron put its first marks on the combat record 
Every plane that could fly was sent into the air 
Cricket took eight ships and went south across the Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan 
Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target 
Fleischman with eight was to patrol the Leyte Gulf area with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships 
Greg himself took two flights with Todman leading the second to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte 
Each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs 
A weapons carrier took Greg Todman Belton Banjo Ferguson and Walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip 
It was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes 
No one had much to say 
The sky glowered down at them 
There was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever 
The truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle 
Donovan snatched Greg's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it 
His face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot 
Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before 
But his hands and those of Donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure 
I've got her as neat as I can Donovan said as he dropped the straps of the Seton harness over Greg's shoulders 
But this goddamn climate 
It's for carabao not airplanes 
We'll make out 
Don't you worry chief Greg replied wondering if he himself believed it 
Yeah 
See you Donovan said as he jumped off the wing 
The expression was his trade-mark his open sesame to good luck and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return 
At the prearranged time Greg started the engine and taxied out 
From the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight he knew Donovan would keep his back to the strip 
He wondered where the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission 
Yet long before the scheduled time for return Donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky 
Greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him 
The dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful 
The pilots' heads looked ridiculously small 
The control tower gave him immediate take-off permission and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan 
Greg's mission was the last to leave and as he circled the ships off Tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again 
To the west the dark green hills of Leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes 
Underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray 
Water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of showers 
The metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it 
He possessed the fighter pilot's horror of bad weather and instrument flying and he wondered if the ceiling did drop whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory 
He shivered in the warm cockpit 
The overcast was solid above him 
As far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it 
They would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated Leyte from Samar and hope that it didn't close in before they returned 
Greg pushed the radio button on his throttle 
Todman let's try to go under this stuff 
Stay in close and we'll go up the valley 
Roger Sweeney Todman called back and pulled his four in and slightly above Greg 
Greg took the formation wide around three A-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the Gulf 
He dropped down to five hundred feet swinging a little north of the city of Tacloban and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain 
The valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn 
It was only a fifteen-minute flight but before it was through Greg felt himself developing a case of claustrophobia 
The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in 
If the other pilots were worried they did not show it 
The formation remained perfect 
When the sea was visible ahead of them the relief was as great as if the sun had come out 
He spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast 
Although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity 
Once Todman thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while Greg covered him 
Somebody beat us to it 
Todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation 
Visibility continued to be limited and Greg was never able to get above a thousand feet 
It was frustrating 
His earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights 
He thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of Fleischman claiming a kill 
But Greg's area remained as placid as a Florida dawn 
Finally as time began to run out he headed into Ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that Intelligence had thought might contain Japanese supplies 
The low clouds made bombing difficult 
There was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run 
The accuracy was deplorable 
One of Greg's bombs hung up and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it 
Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle 
With their load of bombs gone the planes moved swiftly and easily 
Greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home 
Mercifully it was still open 
Like a man making a deep dive Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley 
He was about to make a gas check on his flight when Todman's voice broke in Sweeneys 
Three bogies 
Twelve o'clock level 
Greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument panel 
He saw them specks against the gray but closing fast 
They were headed straight for each other on a collision course 
Friend or enemy 
The same old question 
And only a few seconds to answer it 
Zeros 
Todman said excitedly and hopefully 
And then he thought Todman might be right 
His mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of Aircraft Identification 
He narrowed the shape down to two either a Zero or a U. S. Navy type aircraft 
If it were the enemy tactically his position was correct 
Japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability American on speed and firepower 
His present maximum altitude up against the overcast gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages 
But it also made him conspicuous to the enemy if it was the enemy and he hadn't been spotted already 
But the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course 
In seconds Greg made his decision 
He pushed the radio button 
Sweeney Blue hit the deck 
Lots of throttle 
Todman you take the one on the left 
I'll take the middle 
Belton the one on the right 
If they're Japs 
Let's make sure first 
Greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two Rogers 
The planes light with most of the gas burned out responded beautifully 
Greg's airspeed indicator was over 350 when he leveled off just above the trees 
The opposing aircraft continued to come on 
They appeared to be the enemy 
Greg wished the Air Corps had continued to camouflage planes 
There was of course no way for the other planes to get by them 
It was a box 
But they could turn and escape to the east 
Greg pushed the radio button again 
Todman drop your second element back 
If any of us miss they can pick up the pieces 
Now let's make sure they're Japs 
Even as he said it Greg knew they had found the enemy 
The shapes were unmistakable and the Rising Suns were showing up slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom 
Greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight 
The circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him 
His hands shook 
Arm your guns Sweeneys 
They're Japs 
They're Japs came a high-pitched voice 
Greg to Sweeney Blue 
One pass only 
No turns 
You'll bust your ass in this canyon 
That's an order 
He moved the flights over against one wall 
It gave them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery 
If the turn was too tight a barrel roll would bring them out 
A hell of an altitude for a barrel roll but it could be done 
Greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the RPM and the engine responded as if it had been waiting 
The clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around 
They haven't seen us Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise 
They haven't seen us 
He hit the radio button 
Now Sweeneys now 
Let's take 'em home 
He hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag 
Out of the corner of his eye he watched his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him 
Perfect he thought 
With the rapid rate of closure the approach from below the side and ahead there would be only a moment when damage could be done 
Just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving board 
He tightened his turn 
His nose up 
It was going to be dangerous 
Eight aircraft in this small box 
Please dear God make my pilots good he prayed 
He took a lead on the enemy using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and then added another 
The enemy did not veer 
It did not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted 
Blind fools 
Now 
Greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger 
The plane rumbled and slowed 
Six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished 
As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them 
Greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered 
Luck was with him 
His burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane 
The Jap's propeller flew off in pieces 
A large piece of engine cowling vanished 
It was all Greg had time to see 
His maneuvering for the shot had placed him near the overcast almost inverted and heading up into the clouds 
His speed was dropping rapidly 
If he spun out now he would join his opponent on the ground 
Wingman stay clear he prayed 
He pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back 
He fought the panic of vertigo 
He had no idea which was up and which was down 
He held the controls where they had been 
Sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip 
His air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out 
Over the rattling of fenders humming of tires and chattering of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles 
Cool air moving slowly through the open or smashed-out side windows hinted of blooming roadside vegetation and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirled from the back seat 
Moriarty my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite so final in his tone I once more repeated the absurdity mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced 
We were coming to an intersection turning right chuffing to a stop 
Forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old Mexican Moriarty New Mexico 
Gracias 
Adios I said exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host's daughters 
I waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass 
Then I saw the father's head slightly turn 
gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold 
Autos whizzed past 
White-shirted and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze 
Suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled and thumbing hopefully I saw emergent in windshield flash red lips streaming silk of blonde hair and ah trembling confusion of hope apprehension despair the leering face of old Herry 
Mor-ee-air-teeeee he shrieked his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde 
Over the rapidly-diminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage Herry's black brushcut was just discernible near or enviably near that spot where hidden more delicately-textured most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes 
Damn his luck 
I would have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and Well at least I wouldn't have shouted back a taunt 
Still nursing anger I listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me 
It was stopping 
Just as I straightened up with my duffel bag I heard Sahjunt Yoorick meet Mrs. Major J. A. Roebuck 
The voice was that of Johnson tail gunner off another crew 
Squeezing a look between Johnson's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome and still darkhaired lady inquired Y'all drahve 
I nodded 
Onleh one thiihng Mrs. Roebuck continued 
Ahm goin nawth t'jawn mah husbun in Sante Fe an y'all maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt 
But Corporal Johnson has alreadeh said it didn make no diffrunce t'hi-im 
I said that it didn't make any difference to me either as far as I knew 
How far I knew will shortly become apparent 
Let me pass over the trip to Sante Fe with something of the same speed which made Mrs. Roebuck wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit 35 m.p.h. is still in ee-faket 
I let up on the accelerator only to gradually reach again the 60 m.p.h. which would I hoped overhaul Herry and the blonde and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had I Mrs. Major Roebuck settled down to practicing on Corporal Johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on Colonel and Mrs. Somebody in Sante Fe 
When Johnson ejaculated Howsabout my buying us all a nice cold Co-cola Ma'am 
Mrs. Roebuck smilingly declined and began suddenly to go on about her son who was onleh a little younguh than you bawhs 
Johnson never would have believed she had a son that age 
Mrs. Roebuck thought Johnson was a sweet bawh t'lah lahk thet but her Herman was getting to be a man there was no getting around it 
Just befoh he left foh his academeh we wuh hevin dack-rihs on the vuhranduh Major Roebuck an Ah an Huhmun says May Ah hev one too 
Just as p'lite an an cohnfidunt an Ah says Uh coahse you cain't but he says Whah nawt you ah hevin one 
An Ah coudn ansuh him an so Ah said Aw right Ah gay-ess an his fathuh didn uttuh one wohd an aftuh Huhmun was gone the majuh laughed an tole me thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink t'gethuh f'ovuh a yeah onleh an occasional one but just the same it was behahn mah back an Ah doan think thet's nahce at all d'you 
No I don't Johnson said 
I'm a good Baptist and drinking 
Mrs. Roebuck very kindly let me drive through Sante Fe to a road which would she said lead us to Taos and then Raton and eventshahleh out of New Mexico 
How lightly her eventshah-leh passed into the crannies where I was storing dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus and how the word would echo 
And re-echo 
Hardly had Mrs. Roebuck driven off when a rusty pick-up truck father or grandfather of Senor Moriarty's Ford sedan came screeching to a dust-swirling stop and a brown face appeared its nose threatened by shards of what had once been the side window 
Get in buddies 
Get in 
The straight black hair flopped in a vigorous nod the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back 
Johnson unwired the right hand door whose window was like the left one merely loosely-taped fragments of glass and Johnson wadded himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer 
In back buddy the driver said to me 
Quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack I stepped on the running board 
it flopped down sprang back up and gouged my shin 
The truck was hurtling forward 
I seized the rack and made a western-style flying-mount just in time one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag and merely wrecking my camera I was to discover later my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and but this is no medical report 
I was again in motion and at a speed which belied the truck's similarity to Senor X's Ford turtle 
Maybe I would beat old Herry to Siberia after all 
Whatever satisfaction that might offer 
Something pulled my leg 
I drew back drawing back my foot for a kick 
But it was only Johnson reaching around the wire chicken fencing which half covered the truck cab's glassless rear window 
The way his red rubber lips were stretched across his pearly little teeth I thought he was only having a little joke but no he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear 
Wanna beer 
Hell yes I roared back between dusty lips 
Did I want a beer 
Did an anteater want ants 
Bueno amigo 
Gracias I hollered my first long swallow filling me with confidence and immediately doubling the size of my Spanish vocabulary 
At once my ears were drowned by a flow of what I took to be Spanish but the driver's white teeth flashing at me the road wildly veering beyond his glistening hair beyond his gesticulating bottle it could have been the purest Oxford English I was half hearing 
I wouldn't have known the difference 
Johnson was trying to grab the wheel though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it 
White teeth suddenly vanishing the driver slammed the side of his bottle against Johnson's ear 
We were off the road gleaming barbed wire pulling taut 
I ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards 
We were in a field in a tight screeching turn 
Prairie dogs were popping up and popping down 
When I fell on my back I saw a vulture hovering 
Just as I got to my knees there was again the sound of the fence stretching and I had time only to start taking my kneeling posture seriously 
This time no wire came whipping into the truck 
We were back on the road 
I regained my squatting position behind the truck cab's rear window 
Johnson's left hand was pressed against the side of his head red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers 
Tee-wah the driver cackled his black eyes glittering behind dull silver chicken fencing 
That was Tee-wah I was talking 
You thought I was a Mexican didn't you buddy 
I nodded 
Hell that's all right buddy the Indian I now guessed said 
Drink your beer 
Miraculously the bottle was still in my hand foam still geysering over my luckily waterproof watch 
No sooner had I started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truck 
The beer foamed furiously 
I drank furiously 
A long time 
Emptied the bottle 
Teeth again flashing back at me the driver released a deluge of Spanish in which amigo appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding sound 
I bobbed my head each time it appeared 
Suddenly the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision son of a bitch sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer bottle into Johnson's quivering ribs 
A big car was approaching its chrome teeth grinning 
Beyond it the gray road stretched a long long way 
The car was just about to us its driver's fat solemn face intent on the road ahead on business on a family in Sante Fe on anything but an old pick-up truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue 
I tossed the bottle 
High so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car's steel roof 
Too high 
On unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash 
Aye-yah-ah-ah 
The Indian was again raising his bottle but to my astonished relief probably only a fraction of Johnson's the bottle this time went to the Indian's lips 
Another car was coming a tiny dark shape on a far hill 
I started looking on the splintery truck bed for a piece of board a dirt clod anything I could throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer bottle 
We were slowing 
In the ditch sand was white and soft-looking only an occasional pebble discernible faintly gleaming 
But Johnson couldn't quickly unwire the truck door and if I escaped he might suffer 
The car was approaching fast 
On the truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery 
with more time I could have loosened a small burr or cotter pin 
Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought of the coins in my pocket 
There was no time to pick out a penny 
I got a coin between my thumb and forefinger leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flipped my little missile 
There was a blur just under my focus of vision a crash 
the car's far windshield panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center 
I heard the screech of brakes behind me an insane burst of laughter beneath me 
Looking back I saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number 
S-s-sahjunt 
Johnson's fat hand another bottle were protruding from the truck cab and that self-proclaimed Baptist teetotaler had a bottle at his own lips 
Two cars came over a crest their chrome and glass flashing 
The Indian's arm whipped sidewise there was a flash of amber and froth the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of the first car 
Brakes shrieked behind us 
I saw Johnson's bottle snatched from his hand saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car 
This time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of women 
I looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of the car's rear window 
Drink you son of a bitch 
I quickly turned around and began to drink 
But the Indian was jabbing another bottle toward Johnson 
I guided her to the divan turned off the TV faced her 
She sat quietly staring at me from the wide eyes 
And what eyes they were 
Big and dark a melting golden brown 
Eyes like hot honey eyes that sizzled 
Plus flawless skin smooth brow and cheeks lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them 
It was a disturbingly familiar face too but I couldn't remember where we had met 
I said Do we know each other Miss 
No I remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here and when it happened all I could think of was This time she stopped the rush of words herself 
I'm sorry 
Shall I go on 
She smiled 
It was her first smile 
But worth waiting for 
Sure 
I said 
But one word at a time O.K. 
She was still hugging the stained coat around her so I said Relax let me take your things 
Would you like a drink or coffee 
No thanks 
She stood up pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off then let out a high-pitched scream and I let out a low-pitched wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out 
She was wearing nothing beneath the coat 
She jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again but not soon enough 
There had been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out and now I was certain I'd seen her somewhere before 
I forgot 
She yelped 
Oh do forgive me 
I'm sorry 
I forgive 
That's what started all the trouble in the first place 
Oh dear I'm all unstrung 
You and me both dear 
Haven't we haven't I seen you 
I mean surely we've 
You may have seen me on TV she said 
I've done several filmed commercials for 
Then it hit me 
Zing 
I cried 
Why yes 
And you recognized me 
Yes indeed 
In fact I was watching you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell 
Man you rang it was in color too Miss and Miss 
What's your name anyway 
Ah you were splendid 
I sat by her on the divan 
Splendid 
In a waterfall and all that 
That's the last one we did 
That was a fun one 
I'll bet 
It was fun for me all right 
I don't mean to pry but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles 
I mean Is advertising honest 
It depends on who does it 
I never wear anything at all 
It wouldn't wouldn't seem fair somehow 
I couldn't agree with you more 
I really do have something important to tell you Mr. Scott 
About the murder 
Murder 
Oh yeah I said 
Tell me about the murder 
She told me 
Zing was the creation of two men Louis Thor and Bill Blake partners in zing 
Inc. 
They'd peddled the soap virtually alone and without much success until about a year ago when with the addition of SX-21 to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising campaign sales had soared practically into orbit 
Their product had been endorsed by Good Housekeeping the A.M.A. and the Veterinary Journal among other repositories of higher wisdom and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of their soap in the john even your best friends would think you didn't bathe 
My lovely caller Joyce Holland was her name had previously done three filmed commercials for zing and this evening the fourth a super production had been filmed at the home of Louis Thor 
The water in Thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick foamy soapsuds fashioned of course from zing Joyce had dived from the board into the pool then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious bath while cameras rolled 
The finished and drastically cut product would begin with a hazy longshot of Joyce entering the suds then bursting above the pool's surface clad in layers of lavender lather and I had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap 
even to clean men and boys 
Joyce went on When we'd finished Lou Mr. Thor asked me to stay a little longer 
He wanted a few stills for magazine ads he said 
Everybody left and I stayed in the pool then Lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too 
And he didn't have any clothes on 
He didn't 
Yes he didn't 
Did I mean 
She paused 
Did leap into the pool and didn't have anything on 
Anyway it was evident what he had in mind 
You got away didn't you 
Yes 
He caught up with me once and grabbed me but I was all covered with zing it's very slippery you know 
I didn't know 
I wouldn't have the stuff in the house 
But I'm pleased to hear 
So I just scooted out of his clutches 
I swam like mad got out of the pool grabbed my robe and ran to the car 
The keys were still in it and I was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where I'd changed 
She'd driven around for a while Joyce said then thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that time she'd gone back to his home on Bryn Mawr Drive parked in front and walked toward the pool 
While several yards from it still concealed by the shrubbery she'd seen two men on her left at the pool's edge 
She went on 
A man was holding onto Lou holding him up 
Maybe Lou was only unconscious but right then I thought he must be dead 
The man shoved him into the water then ran past the cabana 
There's a walk there that goes out to Quebec Drive 
I was so scared well I just ran to my car and came here 
You know who the other man was 
No I never did see his face 
I didn't get a good look at him at all his back was to me and I was so scared It was just somebody in a man's suit 
But I'm sure the other one was Lou 
What Joyce wanted me to do was go to Thor's house and do whatever detectives do and get her clothes and handbag containing her identification 
She realized I'd have to notify the police but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name 
Her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series Underwater Western Eye a documentary-type show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits 
But if Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal the role would probably go to the sponsor's wife Mrs. Oatnut Grits 
Or at least not to Joyce 
And I so want the part she said 
The commercials have just been for money there hasn't been any real incentive for me to do them but in Underwater Western Eye I'd have a chance to act 
I could show what I can do 
As far as I was concerned she had already and had dandily shown what she could do 
But I promised Joyce I would mention her name if at all only as a last resort 
Seeming much relieved she smiled one of those worth-waiting-for smiles and I smiled all the way into the bedroom 
There I got my Colt Special and shoulder harness slipped my coat on and went back into the front room 
Joyce squirmed a little on the divan 
I'm starting to itch she said 
Itch 
Yes I'm still all covered with that soap 
I was loaded with suds when I ran away and I haven't had a chance to wash it off 
Mmmm it sure itches 
You might as well wait here while I'm gone so you can use my shower if you'd like 
Oh I'd love to 
I showed her the shower and tub and she said smiling If you really don't mind I think I'll get clean in the shower then soak for a few minutes in your tub 
That always relaxes me 
Doesn't it you 
Only when I do it 
I shook my head 
One of my virtues or vices is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color 
Soak as long as you want Joyce 
It'll probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you 
So you'll have everything all to yourself doggone 
I looked at my watch 
Ten after nine 
Time to go I supposed 
Well goodbye I said 
Goodbye 
You'd better hurry 
Oh you can count on that 
She smiled slightly 
Softly 
Warmly 
Don't hurry too much 
I'll be soaking for at least half an hour 
That was all she said 
But suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them 
However when there's a job to be done I'm a monstrosity of grim determination I like to think 
I spun about and clattered through the front room to the door 
As I went out I could hear water pouring in the shower 
Hot water 
She wouldn't be taking a cold shower 
Hell she couldn't 
Bryn Mawr Drive is only two or three miles from the Spartan and it took me less than five minutes to get there 
But the scene was not the quiet calm scene I'd expected 
Four cars were parked at the curb and two of them were police radio cars 
Lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds 
I followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool 
Two uniformed officers a couple of plain-clothesmen I knew and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left 
At the pool's far end was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp-looking lather 
A few yards beyond the group of men a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra 
Lieutenant Rawlins one of the plain-clothesmen spotted me and said Hi Shell and walked toward me 
How'd you hear about this one 
I grinned but ignored the question 
He didn't push it 
Rawlins worked out of Central Homicide and we'd been friends for years 
He filled me in 
A call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine P.M. and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that 10 minutes ago now 
Present at the scene in addition to the dead man who was indeed Louis Thor had been Thor's partner Bill Blake and Antony Rose an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account 
Neither of them I understood had been present at the filming session earlier 
What were they doing here 
I asked Rawlins 
They were supposed to meet Thor at nine PM for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap a new angle based on this SX-21 stuff 
Yeah I've heard more about SX-21 than space exploration lately 
What is the gunk 
How would I know 
It's a secret 
That was the new advertising angle something about a Lloyd's of London policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient 
Actually only two men know what the formula is Blake and He stopped and looked at Thor's body 
I said O.K. so now only Blake knows 
How's it strike you foul or fair 
Can't say yet 
Deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on 'em 
The PM might show he drowned instead but that's what the once-over-lightly gives us 
Accident murder suicide take your pick 
I'll pick murder 
Anything else 
According to Rose he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started hauling him out 
Too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living 
this is not so for education offers all kinds of dividends including how to pull the wool over a husband's eyes while you are having an affair with his wife 
If it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics I would have been stymied on what to do and now I understand why they are classics 
those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick 
I worked for my Uncle an Uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild undercurrent of incest who ran one of those antique shops in New Orleans' Vieux Carre the old French Quarter 
The arrangement I had with him was to work four hours a day 
The rest of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting 
I had a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants blooming everlastingly in the southern sun 
I had come to New Orleans two years earlier after graduating college partly because I loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there 
When my Uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted 
The arrangement turned out to be excellent 
I loved the city and I particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of Mardi Gras 
I had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide joyous celebration with romance in the air 
and when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner 
The very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure 
It was as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes cover their faces with masks and go adventuring 
My Uncle and I were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages 
Sometimes I wondered vaguely what he did about women for my Aunt by blood had died some years ago but neither of us said anything 
One Monday morning I saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt 
They were married over the week-end though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty 
She looked more like twenty-five or six 
It was really a May and December combination 
My new Aunt was perhaps three or four years older than I and it had been a long time since I had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex 
There was something about the contour of her face her smile that was like New Orleans sunshine the way she held her head the way she walked there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me 
Her legs were the full sexy kind full bodied like a rare wine and just as tantalizing to the appetite 
the calf was magnificent the ankle perfect 
You must forgive me if I seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but I am an artist accustomed to studying the physical body 
The true artist is like one of those scientists who from a single bone can reconstruct an animal's entire body 
The artist looks at an ankle a calf a bosom and in his mind's eye the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is 
And that is the way I first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store 
That she impressed me instantly was obvious 
I was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted them 
I thought I saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks 
True she was my Aunt married to an Uncle related to me only by marriage but why she had married a man twice her age and more perhaps I did not know or much care 
She was standing with her back to the glass door 
Her form was silhouetted and with the strong light I could see the outlines of her body a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired 
As it is in so many affairs of the heart a man and a woman meet and something clicks 
Something clicked in this instance but I treated her circumspectly and I felt that she knew it for we both kept our distance 
When she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my Uncle notice it 
And then I became aware that she too glanced at me surreptitiously 
I felt that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and I a nude model 
I dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but I could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship 
When our eyes met the air was filled with an unuttered message of Me too 
You have probably experienced this 
It is nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity 
Why she married him I do not know 
I myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me 
He already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly while she herself had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living 
Perhaps with my Uncle she found a measure of economic security that she needed 
or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father 
some women with father fixations do 
For several weeks we eyed one another almost like sparring partners and then one day Uncle was slightly indisposed and stayed home 
his bride opened the store 
I was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my Uncle's indisposition 
Even as she was telling me about it I became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks and subconsciously I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights 
The cavernous depth cluttered with antiques echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk 
She placed her palms fingers outspread on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say Now what next 
I was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me the time was opportune 
There was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour 
I was standing beside her watching the outspread palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which he sometimes napped 
I bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up and her two arms encircled me in a bear-like crush 
Her mouth which had been so much in my thoughts was warm and moist and tender 
I heard her murmur We'd better lock the door 
It did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch 
When we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said 
He will not always be indisposed 
I know 
I was thinking about that 
How will we work it out 
I don't know she said 
You're the man 
You figure it out 
I've noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met 
I guess we both felt it 
I said 
I guess so she said 
But now what 
Even as I said it I realized that an education can be invaluable 
I know what we can do I said 
Tell him I made a pass at you 
She raised a protesting hand with a startled air 
What are you trying to do 
Get thrown out 
If I even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew and not even a blood nephew 
I don't want to be thrown out and I don't think I will 
I think I have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting us 
By telling him you are making passes at me 
She said incredulously 
When I was in college I grinned I remember a poem I had to read in my lit class 
I don't even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century poets 
In those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell 
and now I think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us 
Tomorrow Mardi Gras opens officially 
A lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks and having a ball 
There will be romance and flirtation 
If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did so instead of just telling him I made a pass say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse I really am 
We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain 
And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead 
You are both the same size 
He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask 
When I show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it 
But you she began 
Don't worry about me 
It will turn out all right 
I don't understand she insisted 
Are you trying to cut your throat 
No I chuckled I'm just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education 
As we expected on the following day my Uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning 
I felt that he looked at me coldly and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife 
I quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days 
I heard subsequently that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the French Quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date 
Shortly before nine I drove my jalopy to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view 
A few minutes later I saw my Uncle's car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner 
I must say the figure was well made up 
If it were not that I knew who it was I could have mistaken it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit him 
In one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain 
I suspected why he brought it along 
In the half darkness I approached cautiously making sure he did not see me 
He was looking out on the dark waters of the Lake when I came upon him and without wasting words I smacked him hard across the face 
You cheap bitch 
I exclaimed 
You cheap no good two-timing bitch 
You get a good loyal husband smack 
and you fall for a pass by his own nephew 
You should smack 
be ashamed of yourself 
He had better write a postcard to Walter 
He opened the myth book again and there along the margin next to Robert Graves' imaginative interpretation of the creation of the Dactyls from Rhea's fingertips were the names of four Munich bars and Meredith Wilder's address 
The bars were marked as Walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret drawer 
The code which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest Nicolas was determined to find out and put to use 
A card to Walter would get him an introduction to this Meredith and that might be good for something 
Nicolas called on his muse a line came back 
Squaresville man and all the palazzos are crummy Palasts 
That ought to draw a laugh Nicolas reasoned as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind 
And indeed his postcard did draw from Walter a letter recommending his friend the poet Nicolas Manas to his friend Meredith Wilder 
Five days later on receiving it Meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table 
Dammit 
He inwardly cried 
His hand was large and square and heavily tanned 
The voice crying in him was the voice of guilt 
His four weeks in Italy had turned into nearer three months 
He had returned to the pension a week ago 
Now he was just in the late poems of Holderlin and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him plus next semester's class preparation 
He was determined to spend an industrious summer 
Well maybe Manas wouldn't call 
Meredith's fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him Sie lacheln die Schwarzen Hexen 
The menace of Manas gradually faded as Meredith asked himself should he translate it How the dark fates laughed 
Or more rhythmically The swarthy witches are laughing 
And he missed the point that the swarthy witches might be laughing at him for hoping to escape Nicolas Manas 
But Nicolas too was being interrupted that morning 
Not by the 11:00 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the English Gardens and sent him off to sleep 
but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded him 
Should she wake him 
She didn't have the heart 
Her heart her maternal feeling in fact her being was too busy expressing itself as quietly thrilled by this sight of her Nicolas curled asleep under a blanket in a park like a scene from Poussin 
She was just not able to break the spell 
Would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer Nicolas had found his first night in one of Walter's marked bars 
Nicolas Look Nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys no sex see 
So if all these beers was to get me in bed man you just spent a lot of money 
Ballet dancer Protests tears and take what you want Nicolas I am a dancer you are a poet it is all beautiful 
To this meek conjugation Nicolas had replied O.K. I can use this blanket 
And when you get off this job tonight well you can gimme something to eat 
And as a matter of fact Nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night when he discovered that Munich's early mornings even in summer are laden with dew 
He had always known how to find a bed and on his own terms 
He used the blanket for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions 
Mary Jane Lerner knew none of this 
Her Nicolas lay curled in the sun like a fawn black hair falling over his eyes 
She was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth 
This was surely a reunion in art it was all that poetry promised 
That long night with Nicolas and marijuana in Venice had opened her eyes 
His advice his voice saying his poems the fact that he had not so much as touched her on the contrary he had put his head back and she had stroked his hair this was all new 
Her eyes had opened she had caught a glimpse of a new faith 
The next day he was gone 
Mary Jane might not be the most intelligent woman but she was one of the most determined 
Even so it took her several days to force Walter to tell her Nicolas's whereabouts 
Packing a small suitcase informing her husband whom she found in Harry's Bar that she was taking a train to Germany to get away for a while patting his arm refusing a drink getting on the train all this had only taken her two hours 
She had arrived this morning and come straight to the English Gardens 
Dear girl Walter had finally said he writes me that he is sleeping in the English Gardens 
How like him 
Mary Jane had smilingly said 
His address Walter added is that great foundling home the American Express 
And I will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband 
For the last half hour Mary Jane had criss-crossed half the length of the Gardens and at last come upon her knight 
His presence there asleep in the grass confirmed all that Mary Jane believed it was in his power to teach her freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels the meaning of nature how to live simply with the angels 
She set down her suitcase 
Should she wake him 
No 
Smiling she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched 
The sun grew hotter as it approached the midday 
Nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the dashboard of a speeding car 
He began sweating 
In his dream he cried Slow down for Chrissake 
He half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass 
His nose was tickled 
He sneezed 
He blew his nose expertly between his fingers 
He spit 
He half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then more vigorously between his legs 
He belched he stretched 
Mary Jane got up quietly and walked away 
Twenty minutes later she was at the desk of the Grafin's pension her tears dried signing a hotel form and asking for a bath 
Mary Jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions in all the major and minor cities 
She had retreated to this world 
The Grafin who was charmed by her told her Your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair 
Families are very interesting 
Nevertheless there is no bath 
But a young American has a bath next to his room and I shall ask him if you might use it this once 
And then we shall see 
The Grafin was partial to the word shall 

Meredith was irritated when the Grafin knocked at his door and told him She is a great beauty 
Shall we allow her not to have a bath 
Actually she is a sad beauty I believe 
You shall see her at dinner 
Rather erotically he listened to the bath water running 
when it stopped he began busily typing sitting up in a virtuous way 
Before dinner he shaved for the second time that day 
A thing he did not like doing generally 
Singing into the mirror and his interested eyes he was pleased to note when he stripped for his own bath that he still had the best part of his Italian sun tan 
He flexed his muscles for several minutes got into the tub and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed 
In the small gallery used as the guests' dining room Meredith sat down at his place and as always began teasing the young waitress 
He was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets she also served as maid when he saw the Grafin followed by a stately blond girl approaching his table 
It would be literary license calculated to glamorize life to say that he oh dropped his napkin so startled was he by Mary Jane's beauty 
Yet he did drop his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the Grafin as acknowledgement that here indeed was something special 
Mary Jane had made very little effort 
Above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with as he soon perceived no brassiere beneath 
Her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders 
Perhaps her eyes were larger and more of a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day 
She had touched her face truly a noble and pure face only with a lip salve which made her lips glisten but no redder than usual 
The result was grace and modesty 
As she was rather tired this evening her simple Thank you for the use of your bath when she sat down opposite him spoken in a low voice came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control 
Meredith began falling in love 
Soup Only this morning 
veal cutlets Oh I couldn't possibly eat all this 

Wine Then you were typing poems this afternoon 

Fruit compote If you think I would understand it 
a smile 
What a beautiful room 
Like as if it were built of books 
Having opened the windows onto the terrace lit the fire translated the motto Meredith grinned and took down a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin 
Opening these he brought out a schnapps bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses hidden inside it 
I think the maids tipple in the afternoon 
Those sweet girls 
Oh you're joking 
It tastes a little like poppyseed 
What's its name 
Steinhager She whispered Steinhager to herself several times memorizing it 
Would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me read it to myself 
Meredith's voice was always deep with rough bass notes in it 
in reading on platforms even in the large auditorium of the Y.M.H.A. Poetry Center nights his voice was intimate thoughtful and a trifle shy 
His new poem a love poem told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed 
The husband points the steps out with his flashlight Its white stare filling her pale eyes To the blind brim with appetite Bleaching her hands that grazed my thighs And sent us from the table in surprise To let the dishes soak all night Mary Jane asked herself if Meredith was blushing at this line or was it the fire 
But he read on 
In the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed the lights go on In dull domestic radiance I watch her staring face still blind Start wincing in obedience To dirty waters counters pots and pans Waiting below stairs in her mind 
Mary Jane took the page from him and began reading it moving her lips with the words 
Oh it's that myth about Orpheus and What is her name 
I can never pronounce it 
She repeated Eurydice 
The third time rather urgently 
But with her hand poem again 
She raised her face and nodded It's sweet and very sad 
They discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds 
They finished the small bottle of Steinhager 
She confessed she was unhappy he asked was it her husband 
She began to explain There was this poet in Italy He interrupted Please don't judge all poets 
They smiled 
At her door two or three hours later Mary Jane whispered Everyone is asleep 
Kissing her he whispered several times Eurydice 
The third time rather urgently 
But with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited expectant and finally faintly grinning with the feel of her hand against his mouth 
They were west of the Sabine but only God knew where 
For three days their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea 
Molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson 
suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping 
dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs 
And the valley stretched endlessly out ahead scorched and baked and writhing in its heat until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze 
Ben Prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen 
Hoa-whup 
He commanded from his raw throat and felt the pain of movement in his cracked black burned lips 
He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face 
He spat 
The dust-thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton 
He moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played-out limbs 
The burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes in salt-edged patches 
He cleared his throat and wet his lips 
As cheerfully as possible he said Well I guess we could all do with a little drink 
He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel 
They could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation 
The water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste 
But it was water 
Thank the Lord they still had water 
He cleansed his mouth with a small quantity 
He took a long but carefully controlled draught 
He replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck 
She took it grudgingly her dark eyes baleful as they met his 
She drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face 
She set the dipper on the edge of the deck leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully 
What happens when there's no more water 
She asked smolderingly 
She was like charcoal he thought dark opaque explosive 
Her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal 
Her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up 
And all the time she had the heat of hatred in her like charcoal that is burning on its under side but not visibly 
A ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws but he kept control upon his voice 
There must be some water under there 
He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river 
We can get it if we dig he said patiently 
And add fever to our troubles 
She scoffed 
Or do you want to see if I can stand fever too 
We can boil it he said 
Her chin sharpened 
We're lost and burning up already she bit out tensely 
The tires are rattling on the wheels now 
They'll roll off in another day 
There was no valley like this on your map 
You don't even know where we're headed 
Hettie he said as gently as he could we're still headed west 
Somewhere we'll hit a trail 
Somewhere 
She repeated 
Maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves 
His wide mouth compressed 
In a way he couldn't blame her 
He had picked out this pathless trail instead of the common one in a moment of romantic fancy to give them privacy on their honeymoon 
It had been a mistake but anything would have been a mistake as it turned out 
It wasn't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her 
She had hated the whole idea before they started 
Actually she had hated him before she ever saw him 
It had been five days too late before he learned that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum administered by her mother 
The bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound 
She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder 
He had left her inviolate thinking familiarity would gentle her in time 
But each mile westward she had hated him the deeper 
He stared at the dipper turning it over and over in his wide calloused hands 
I suppose he muttered I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks once we find a settlement 
Don't try to be noble 
Her laugh was hard 
They wouldn't have sold me in the first place if there'd been food enough to go around 
He winced 
Hettie they didn't sell you he said miserably 
They knew I was a good sharecrop farmer back in Carolina but out West was a chance to build a real farm of our own 
They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them 
Without money or property what would you have had at Baton Rouge 
I might have starved but at least I wouldn't be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt 
He darkened under his heavy burn 
His blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead 
To his puzzlement there suddenly was no haze 
The valley lay clear and open to the eye right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead 
Then he noticed the clouds racing upon them heavy ominous leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills 
He had never seen clouds like them before but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in Carolina 
He hollered hoarsely Hang on 
And goaded the oxen as he yelled 
He wanted to turn them putting the wagon against the storm 
Too late he realized that in turning he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground instead of atop a grade or ridge 
He swung up over the wheel 
You had better get inside he warned her 
But she sat on in stubborn silence 
The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel 
Frozen they stared at it whirling down the valley gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones 
The six-ton Conestoga began to whip and shake 
Their world turned black 
It was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence 
The heavens opened pelting them with hail the size of walnuts 
And then came the water not rain but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket 
Walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods 
Through the splash of the rising waters they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon gnashing big chunks out of the banks 
The jetting frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff 
The dangerous current upon the prairie ceased but the water stood and kept on rising 
They cringed under sodden covers listening to the waves slop against the bottom 
The cloudburst cut off abruptly 
They were engulfed by the weird silence broken only by the low angry murmur of the river 
Then the darkness thinned and there was light again and then bright sunlight 
Beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills 
The water level was higher than their hubs 
Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored 
There was no real sign of the river now just a roiling oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere 
Clumps of brush rode down the ribbon 
Now and then the glistening side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past 
The girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine hugging her shoulders and still trembling 
Her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for Ben 
Out of compulsion to say something cheery Ben Prime blurted Well we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit 
At least the wheels dug in 
The soaking will put life back in the wagon too 
His wife didn't give a sign she'd heard 
She was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current 
Somebody was riding the tree 
It raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair sitting astride an upright branch 
She did not call out 
But as the tree passed she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell 
They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend 
It speared up into the air then sinking back the up-jutting branch turned slowly 
The pale blob of the woman disappeared 
There's the one who's lucky 
The girl murmured harshly 
Ben's eyes strained with the bitter hurt his homely face slashed with gray and crimson 
Then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts needing their comfort more than they needed his 
It was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon half-swimming his way for he was not a tall man 
He let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water 
He sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward 
They were already swollen to bursting 
Of all their worldly belongings next to the oxen and his gun the seed grain had been the most treasured 
It was spoiled now for seed and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it 
The oxen might as well enjoy it 
He examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished 
The waters lay muddy but placid without a ripple of movement against the wheels 
there was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding 
He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate dry hills that rimmed the valley 
A terrible numbing sense of futility swept over him 
He gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat 
Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen 
The spokes were tight again the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece 
Hope surged within him 
He swung toward the front to give the news to Hettie then stopped barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate 
Still he felt better 
A tight wagon meant so much 
He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee 
He poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour salvaging the chunky watery messes for biscuits of a sort 
Their jams and jellies had not suffered 
He found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save 
Now he broke them open hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing Hettie 
His long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating java but the fire was low and he wanted to waste no time 
He furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins leaving the ribs and wagon open 
He looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk holding her meager treasures 
He said hesitantly Hettie I don't figure your things got wet too much 
That's a good trunk 
If you want to get them aired 
She said without turning her head After that rain beating in atop the dust there isn't a thing that won't be streaked 
He drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs 
Sulphur oil and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of 
I suppose a Lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze 
Now roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep not knowing what to do 
The lifeboats were stuck fast 
We couldn't budge them 
I heard a cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame leaped from a hatch and tongued the man's bare back 
He sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters 
One especially bad detonation shook Lifeboat No. 3 which trembled violently in the davits 
Brassnose yelled Come on Sommers Max step on it we got a chance now 
Heave on those ropes 
the boat's come unstuck 
We pulled and swore and yanked and wept scraping our hands until they bled profusely 
The Bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare 
Her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water 
Brassnose Max and I leaped into the sea and swam to the boat 
Let's get away fast said Brassnose shaking water from his mop of bleached hair 
That tub is going to explode all at once 
Then the Bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a roar of live steam geysers of sparks and flames and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke 
Dimly we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we couldn't go back into that inferno 
Already our leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water 
Sommers you bale while we row Brassnose commanded 
As best as I could determine we were some 700 miles west of New Guinea in the Bismark Archipelago 
Three days previously we had steamed past barren Rennell Island in the distance 
Now we peered anxiously for any speck of land in the Pacific for this interminable bailing would have to stop soon 
There were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands 
our muscles were hot wires of pain 
Brassnose was strangely silent 
The big man with the whitened hair murmured something his words sounded as if they were in the Manu tongue which I recognized having studied the dialect in my Anthropology 6 class at the University of Chicago 
He then said something which struck a chord in my memory 
God help us if we're near the island of Eromonga 
We'd be in real trouble then 
I'd rather keep bailing or sink 
I was puzzled by the remark then I recalled the voice of mild Professor Howard Griggs three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies 
He had been speaking of this archipelago 
Even when the islands were under German mandate before World War 1 Europeans gave Eromonga a wide berth 
The place is inhabited by several hundred warlike women who are anachronisms of the Twentieth Century stone age amazons who live in an all-female matriarchal society which is self-sufficient 
I remembered too the jesting voice of a classmate Bobby Pauson But how do they reproduce Dr. Griggs 
I'm sure that males have something to do with that process 
There had been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as Professor Griggs said dryly I see your point Pauson 
Of course males play a role there but believe me when I say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on Eromonga 
Indeed you wouldn't live long for the females either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes or they destroy them by revolting but ingenious methods 
In fact one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men 
I think I know what you mean Brassnose I said 
I know something about Eromonga 
Let's hope we come to a safer place 
But we didn't 
Three hours later while we were bailing desperately a dot of land came into view 
Foster Lukuklu Frayne made a sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs I recognized it as an ancient Manu gesture intended to propitiate the Devil 
A half-hour passed 
we had drifted closer 
In a voice so frightened as to seem not his own the big bo'sun's mate quavered 
Tchalo 
It is Eromonga look hard you can see with your naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff 
I squinted at the looming shoreline 
There was a wooden tower or derrick there something like a ski jump 
it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been artfully constructed of logs 
A fine example of engineering in a primitive society 
What is the scaffolding for Brassnose 
He made a sound of despair deep in his throat 
It was embarrassing to see strapping blonde Brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen 
Aaa-ee 
It is their tultul the jumping platform of death 
It is the last of the three tests of manhood which the women impose to discover if a male is worthy of survival there 
Often I heard my uncles and cousins speak of it when I was a small boy growing up in Rabaul 
They had never seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers 
Our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what I had heard of the inhabitants of Eromonga I was glad to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft 
I expected Brassnose as a man with a strain of Melanesian in his blood to speak to them 
But he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked 
So I mustered my few words of the Manu dialect and said We greet you in peace 
In ngandlu 
My friends and I come from a ship which was destroyed by fire 
We are thirsty and hungry 
our sore and burned hands and arms need attention 
The girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me 
I noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair 
She said My name is Songau and these girls are Ponkob and Piwen 
You are welcome to Eromonga 
My people await you on the shore 
You shall have food water and rest 
Thirty minutes later the outrigger grated on sand and other girls waiting on shore rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder 
I saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there 
I looked 
All my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight 
There was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls at the base of the big wooden derrick 
Some had been there for years 
others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them 
There was one object which sickened yet fascinated me 
This was also a corpse a male judging from the coral arm bands the tribal scars still discernible on the maggoty face the painted bone of the warrior caste which still pierced the septum of the rotting nose 
The body may have been two or three weeks' dead 
I looked with revulsion at the legs 
They were shattered 
Many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh 
The man must have leaped to his death from the topmost rung of the tultul 
As if divining my thoughts the girl Songau smiled warmly and said in the casual tone an American woman might use in describing her rose garden 
This is our tultul a jumping platform aku 
Later you shall know it better 
Is it not well-made 
Our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons ago 
It took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one which is higher and stronger than the old one 
We are very proud of it 
You have every right to be I replied gravely in the Manu dialect but my attention was fixed on Brassnose the biggest and strongest of us 
He looked as if he was going to keel over 
I felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these girls that we were afraid 
Not so soon anyway 
I clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily hoping it would make an impression on the women This one is the maku Frayne 
He speaks your language too for he is the grandson of a chieftain on Taui who made much magic and was strong and cunning 
The maku Frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather 
This was the worst thing I could have said 
Brassnose turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly Sommers you meddling Yank you're a fool 
They despise males who brag of their strength 
they destroy such men with their damned tests 
You've ruined me blast you 
At first I thought he was out of his head talking wildly like this 
But a glance at Songau and the other women confirmed what Brassnose had blurted out 
The women's faces had hardened after my statement 
At a nod from Songau four lithe and muscular girls darted to Frayne's side and seized him by the arms 
The man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle 
but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived 
Besides terror had sapped some of Frayne's vitality and will 
My last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face 

In the Manu tongue eromonga means manhood a quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were imbibed 
In the hut to which I was assigned Max had his own quarters my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases 
Her name was L'Turu and she told me many things 
For an anthropologist loquacious old L'Turu was a mine of information 
Though I had a great dread of the island and felt I would never leave it alive I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women 
Her account was later confirmed by the Scobee-Frazier Expedition from the University of Manitoba in 1951 

From L'Turu I heard that until about 1850 the people of this island which was about the size of Guam or smaller had been of both sexes and that the normal family life of Melanesian tribes was observed here with minor variations 
But in the middle of the last century an island woman named Karipo seized a spear in the heat of an inter-tribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled 
Miraculously Karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the isle of Pamasu back to their war canoes after considerable loss of life on both sides 
Karipo was something of a politician as well as a militarist 
She quickly exploited the exalted position she now occupied by harassing the disorganized males and even putting many of them to death 
Within a decade or less few men were left and a feminist society had sprung up 
Karipo was great goddess told our mothers that men were not necessary except to father children the crone told me 
All men went away from here 
Those who stayed had to pass tests 
Few passed 
She cackled with mirth showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth 
Karipo's women then named this place Eromonga manhood for just the strongest men could stay here 
Come I show you 
The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood 
In the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling I saw four figures in a semi-circle on the ground 
I guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized then headed for home 
Maybe to beat up on his squaw 
Benson looked up and saw Ramey's long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the stiff edge of the overall bib 
Ramey reached out with the tire iron and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack 
I'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't understand the liquor or automobiles 
Somehow the thought of a simple man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver 
For a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened 
Maybe the Indian wasn't too much at fault Ramey thought 
Maybe he was only doing the best he knew how like any of us 
Anyway he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at 
Ever see yourself spread out on the pavement Benny 
He said to his partner 
You mean dream 
Not exactly 
Just see it 
Benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble 
Nope just you all the time sometimes I think it's the only way I'll ever get a decent partner 
Ramey smiled but he thought to himself I always see me too 
Never Benny 
Whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind 
Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think 
With this realization sometimes he saw himself as he looked down 
You seen him yet 
Benson said referring to the Indian 
He wasn't in the car Ramey said 
You didn't go clear around Benson said 
If you want to see something he's back on the other side by the trunk of the car 
Too long a waiting line Ramey answered pretending to joke 
A few minutes later the insurance man a road checker drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state 
It was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed 
Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed 
All the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane 
Horsely an agent on the east end wore the hat trying to look like a tourist 
It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist an ex-truck driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head 
The insurance man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town 
He chatted with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer 
Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear 
When they were ready to leave Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer 
There's a body you won't mind looking at Benson said and they stopped 
She had driven up with her husband in a convertible with Eastern license plates although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that 
She wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt 
Slender and tanned her dark brown hair was drawn straight back simply 
What outfit does she drive for 
Benson said 
Seeing her caused a lurch in Ramey a recognition 
She might have been someone he had once loved 
He had never seen her before but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities at each end of their run 
The truck routes the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay 
How would you ever see her again 
The feeling subsided it was only a small yearning 
Their work was lonely 
What's she doing in this bunch 
Benson said and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been 
The girl looked around at the countryside 
Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing 
It made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on 
She began to watch a blonde-haired man also in shorts standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly 
What had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see but Benson knew what it was 
The girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson in that barefoot courtliness Ramey could never decide was real said You don't want to go around there Ma'am 
The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her 
The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car 
The two drivers moved closer 
What does he want a spoon 
Benson said to Ramey 
One tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain 
With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian's foot that he would always remember 
The laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top 
The slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot yet the toes were still inside 
The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man 
He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck the sleeves pushed above the elbows 
He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes immaculate eyes 
He was very tanned big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster 
He's dead isn't he 
The man said 
He turned and bent over the body of the Indian 
There was nothing in particular on the man's face 
It was simply a matter of curiosity a natural right to examine 
What's this 
The man said backing up a step still looking down 
His words were mostly to himself 
Don't 
There was a gentle concern in Benson's voice 
Ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement 
But what is it 
The man said with a tone of impatience 
But what is it 
The man had spoken only once 
Ramey heard the words again inside weakened the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears 
The sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey's vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man's leg 
Ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin 
He stared at the shining shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees Don't do that fella 
Them's brains 
The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again with his fist 
Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth 
It was a straight solid once-in-a-lifetime shot 
he laid all four knuckles in between the man's cheekbone and his chin 
Ramey's fist and the air expelled from the man's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together 
The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement 
Ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand 
As he watched the man sit suddenly a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was really to knock a man off his feet 
He hadn't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard 
With a thoughtful look the man sat on the pavement legs straight out in front of him 
His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves and his mouth was slightly open 
After what seemed several seconds the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it 
The man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth 
He moaned and pulled the hand away 
Even yet there was no realization in his eyes 
Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him 
He did not look around 
What happened 
Someone said 
He's hurt 
A woman's voice said and then he heard a sort of wail from the man's wife 
The man on the ground began to move 
one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him 
Blood dripped down the front of his sweater soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder as though the bright V woven into the neckline had melted running a darker color 
The girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back 
Can you hear can you talk to me 
She begged 
An incoherent puzzled sound came from the red mouth 
The girl looked around quickly at several of the people 
None of the crowd had stepped forward to help 
Then she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment 
Why did you do it why did you hit him 
She said her voice rising 
Ramey said nothing 
A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again 
Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers 
No one seemed to know for sure what had happened nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver beyond finding out 
Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman 
Benson moved his arms gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly 
Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man 
Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey 
It's all over now the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them 
Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer 
He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol 
All right step back 
The patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis 
He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him 
You all right 
Mough it's my mough the man said trying to talk without moving his lips 
His brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it 
Then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head caught in the wicker back of the chair the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute 
The body continued to lash but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome bloody mass out of the bungalow 
He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up alarmed at the sound of the shots 
He heard their chattering and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes 
It was only then that he turned to look at Penny 
She was sitting on the edge of the bed again back in the same position where the snake had found her 
The fear had not entirely gone from her face but there were some other emotions now crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth 
But her hands were calm now 
She's got guts thought Keith 
She's got more guts than any other woman in the world 
Keith said Penny Keith you were wonderful 
I don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life but I am 
Thank you Keith 
He smiled at her sincerity 
And for the hundredth time that week he was startled at her beauty 
Strange 
Seven years they'd been married 
He knew her mind pretty well by now its quick perceptions and sympathies its painful insistence on truth and directness its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate even in part 
But her beauty always surprised him anew 
I realize that this is hardly the time to say it Penny said Keith 
But knowing you I know that you're glad to be alive and grateful and sorry because I killed the snake even though I had to 
Isn't that so 
Penny lowered her eyes 
Yes she said almost in a whisper as if admitting to a crime 
The snake was beautiful wasn't it 
Asked Keith his voice getting harsher in spite of himself as he struggled to control his growing anger 
It was a king cobra the largest you ever saw and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle didn't it 
didn't it 

Penny did not answer 
Now she just sat there looking at him without an expression except concern for him 
We're all God's creatures aren't we 
Keith was snarling now 
All of us every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle 
You love this village and these stinking brown people because they're God's creatures too 
And you love Ahmiri that black bastard of a servant even a little more because he's a beautiful man 
And he loves you because you're a beautiful woman 
We're all God's creatures aren't we Penny 
All of us that is except me 
You hate me you hate my guts because I like to hunt 
You actually hate me and we both know it because I killed that filthy snake 
Well why don't you say something 
Penny would not rise to his mood 
There isn't anything left to say is there Keith 
She softly let herself into the bed and took her regular side away from the door where she slept better because Keith was between her and the invader 
He knew she was not sulking not even angry at him 
Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him 
The Brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet 
For a brief period each year the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long meandering journey to the sea running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam past the Khasi Hills and into Bengal past Sirinjani and Madaripur until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal 
Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space 
But Keith looked down more than up 
He thought of the jungles below him and of the wild strange untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return on foot perhaps to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted and animals the lords 
At first it had been just a romantic dream of his the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war 
But after the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself 
Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes to their men or to themselves 
And Keith's record of kills made him a man to listen to a man paradoxically who might even survive 
He became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates 
The RAF was Britain's weapon of attrition and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war 
He knew how to shoot down Nazis 
And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back saying that he was one up on everybody else including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it because he was chemically incapable of fear 
That was true but only half the truth 
The other half he didn't like to recognize even to himself 
He enjoyed the killing 
Not defending England or being an ace or fighting for humanity 
He enjoyed killing 
And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi 
Nowadays we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish 
The Nazis bombed Britain so the RAF retaliated and shot them all down 
Not quite 
It was a war of nerves of stamina of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis who were better organized and technically superior 
It took a long time before the British tipped the balance 
Keith learned too much about air combat and air killing to be risked 
They grounded him over his protests not including his true reason for wanting to fly and put him in the Command offices 
That was where he met Penny 
He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work regardless of how important she might have thought she was in the Command offices but that was all 
Penny knew him better on her part 
He had a war reputation but this was the kind of man women like even without medals 
They don't go for bull-like muscle as a rule 
He had strength in his six-foot frame but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier 
He was on the thin side with big hands and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep 
His hair was black already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom the only one permitted to a man 
The pretty little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles and Penny hating the cliche had to admit that in this case it applied 
Keith was an eagle 
Penny and Keith had no romance 
No dates or hand-holding 
But they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly 
The Command offices were in the border country up north where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy 
The Nazis knew this of course and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers they let a few drop every time they went over hoping for a lucky hit 
This time they had been lucky 
The Command post was underground and well camouflaged 
But there hadn't been enough time to build it for keeps 
There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer if as efficacious when a direct hit comes along 
This one was actually more of a near miss 
The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post but not precisely into the Command room itself 
There was a shattering cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle the air filled with dust and flying debris and everyone in the room men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks as ordered 
That is everyone but Keith and Penny 
They stood there just the two of them in the rocking shattering blast 
Keith was on his feet because he didn't care at all about life any more Penny on her feet proudly because she cared too much 
The bomb was a solitary one 
The blast damaged but did not destroy the room 
Keith's eyes met Penny's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction 
And as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded and mark the several killed he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his 
The chaplain married them on the next day 
After the war Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her 
She came from Ohio from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres as indeed it was to farmer-type farmers 
But to Keith's London-bred mind such acreage sounded rather invincible 
It wasn't that however which decided them not to go to America 
Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma 
He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains and the jungles 
He didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself 
He couldn't stop killing 
That was his true love not Penny 
The terrible power of a gun the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body man or beast was one he never wanted to lose 
And in the hunting land this hunger was considered to be a noble thing 
When they got to Shillong in Assam he was happy 
This is a paradise for hunters 
This was the land of the sladang the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread 
The great black leopards 
The sambur buck the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk 
He even hunted elephant although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African cousin 
But there are big rogues in both countries 
These were the ones Keith sought out the loners the ones who killed for the joy of it like himself 
He and Penny would go out on tame elephants raised from babyhood in the keddah 
And while he was ever alert for game and most particularly a tiger Penny marvelled at the Eden they were traversing 
They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools 
Peacocks strutted across their path preening 
There were fantastic flowers without perfume and gaudy birds without song 
Mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close 
Wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes and grunted derision when they didn't consider such game worthy of a shot from the 
Now the next morning they were anchored at The Elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms with the weighted line beside it 
and Robinson Roy who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive was already back on the surface 
He and his safety man Herr Schaffner swam up to the boarding ladder together 
The German courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first 
Robinson clambered heavily into the boat sat down and stripped off his triple-tank assembly 
He was frowning 
He took his mask from his forehead and threw it unexpectedly across the deck 
Temper temper Mrs. Forsythe said laughing uneasily 
A phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty but irreparably stringy in the neck she was already working on her second gin and tonic though it was not yet ten A.M. 
I loused it Rob said with a savage note in his voice 
All I have to do to set the record is to go on down 
So instead I come up 
Was it my equipment 
The German asked 
Was it something went bad with the breathing 
The equipment was fine Rob stated standing up 
He was a huge young man of twenty-four clothed in muscle immensely strong with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation 
He stared stonily at the floor 
I was down to 275 
I've been that far half a dozen times 
I don't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick 
Well I get it Artie said still on the ladder 
You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record 
And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself 
So you turn around 
No it wasn't that Rob said 
A note of awe came into his voice 
When I came up damnit I thought I was going down 
I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening 
Pressure-happy Artie said and climbed in 
That's right Robinson said 
I was expecting it sure 
But when it happens to you like that I tell you and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were well it makes you think 
You don't head back down again 
Not me anyway 
Not right away 
He had his voice under control again no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him 
Waddell the newspaperman was a fellow in his middle forties with a graying crewcut heavy-framed glasses and a large jaw padded with fat 
Now he was going to show how much he knew 
Our boy didn't chicken out no sir 
He ran into the rapture of the depths 
Nitrogen narcosis 
It makes the diver feel drunk 
Well that's the only way to be Mrs. Forsythe said and gave her brassy laugh 
Maybe not if you're 200 feet under water Artie said 
Anyway Waddell went on 
It's nothing to fool with 
It can kill you 
Personally I don't blame him for giving up the dive much as I regret losing the story 
Nobody's giving anything up Robinson said 
He stood there towering over them all gentle mighty determined the moving force in the group 
and yet like a child among adults 
You think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride 
I'm going down again 
That's my boy 
Mr. Forsythe exclaimed 
Rob's not going to give up as easy as all that 
He was a florid puffy man in his early sixties very natty in his yachting cap striped jacket and white flannels 
He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of Commodore was never used without irony 
Old Commodore Forsythe who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first 
Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again Rob was his boy the kid he had rescued from the streets the object of his pride 
Why he went on when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip I didn't think twice about it 
I've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother's tackle shop 
Hell I gave him the first decent job he ever had six seven how many years ago was it Rob 
Seven years ago Commodore Rob said impassively 
He was thinking big deal skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started 
Excuse me he said abruptly 
He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters 
went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him 
When you gotta go you gotta go Mrs. Forsythe said 
Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge 
He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley 
Hi there Schaffner he had said 
Can I make you one 
No thank you very much Schaffner had answered in his accented English 
I do not drink so much thank you 
Waddell had looked the man over trying to size him up 
He was in his early forties rather short and very compactly built and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways 
His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence until one looked into his eyes which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence 
Waddell had heard that he had been a commando in Rommel's Afrika Corps and he said to himself I'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night 
Aloud he had said making conversation 
Rob tells me he's using your Atlantis equipment on the dive 
Yes Herr Schaffner had said 
He's one hell of a decent boy 
I like that kid 
I agree yes 
And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country is that right 
Well no Herr Schaffner said 
Waddell turned to face him 
No 
He asked 
But that's what he told me 
Why that's his main reason for making the dive 
Shaffner looked at him altogether without guile and shrugged his shoulders making a little spreading gesture with his two hands 
What do you mean 
Waddell asked frowning 
Please let me explain the German said earnestly his face still devoid of deceit 
I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year 
Now I wish to enter the American market where the competition is very strong 
I must have a powerful representative here a firm with a national distribution and ten twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products 
With all respect to a fine young man Mr. Roy is not able to provide these necessaries 
Waddell was not an eminently moral person but he did not like what he had just heard 
Did you tell him all this 
He asked 
Perhaps not in so many words the German said 
But surely you have misunderstood Mr. Roy 
Never never did I offer him the exclusive rights 
We spoke of the need for advertising and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity 
He was most eager to make the dive 
of course I was willing 
But there was no definite agreement about business arrangements 
Well damn Waddell said 
There was the end of his front-page feature story with byline 
He started out the door 
One moment 
Herr Schaffner said 
You intend to speak with Mr. Roy 
What else 
Waddell asked 
If you will pardon I think it would be better if not 
Mr. Roy is determined to make this dive 
Whatever you tell him he will dive 
I know this from my talks with him 
Well let's let him make up his own mind OK 
Waddell said 
On the basis of the facts 
You will make him unhappy and anxious the German said 
At 200 300 400 feet under the water when he must be paying very much attention he will be thinking about what you are telling him 
It is not good Mr. Waddell you will do him great harm 
There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said 
Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk 
I am an honest man the German said with fervor 
I will give Mr. Roy his due for this dive 
I will make him distributor for all of Florida a big market 
All tourists come to Florida 
This will help him to get out of his little tackle shop 
Yes 
But there is no use causing him to worry at this time 
The German's words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty 
He took a big swig of his drink 
It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this 
I think maybe you're right Schaffner he said 
He has the distributorship for Florida you say 
Yes the German said 
At least for South Florida 
By God Waddell said we don't want to upset the boy at this time of all times 
I guess you're right 
He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps 
The story was shaping up nicely in his mind the young pioneer as of old altruistically braving the unknown 
the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America 
Join me in another 
He had asked 
Thank you the German had said courteously 
I do not drink so much 
Now in that same cabin Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk 
Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions 
He pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper 
Blessed Saint Nicholas I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered 
And when I make the dive again He paused 
crossed himself 
said a Hail Mary slowly and with understanding 
Folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck he took his appeal direct to Headquarters 
Holy Mary Mother of God Star of the Sea stay Thou with me on this next dive 
Make it come off all right 
Let me set the record this time and let me get back OK so the German will give me the exclusive 
And make my life different and better from this time on 
Amen 
He crossed himself again and rose 
He felt a good deal less shaky 
As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie who came in and sat down on a bunk 
Artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger 
He waited awhile before he said Roy you know your decompression table don't you 
You know I know it Robinson answered warily 
You came straight up from 275 without a stop Artie said 
Well I was a little bit confused 
Anyway I wasn't down long enough to matter 
You don't see me stretched out on the deck do you 
You know what they say about two deep dives in one day Artie went on still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently 
I don't think you should go down again 
Early that day Matsuo saw a marine 
The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot then fled without knowing the result ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery 
As his feet slowed he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand 
He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed 
In the leafiest part of the tree straddling a broad horizontal limb he could see over the meadow 
For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time 
He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column and while his shot had probably bred indecision they would soon come hunting 
His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure 
Yesterday 
today 
tomorrow no surrender 
His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace only a faint chill of doubt 
He murmured to himself with firmness No surrender 
It was best to die fighting the marines 
His superiors had also preached this saying it was the way for eternal honor 
What if the marines never came 
His comrades were all dead 
He had no rice 
Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide 
Whichever the way he would rot in this vast choking green his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes 
He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk 
His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife 
The knife an ammunition pouch and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt 
Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth 
As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing 
Gloom receded 
The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed as though debating whether to brave the sunlight 
His fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist 
Come out come out in the meadow Matsuo said under his breath 
The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face 
A signal 
Matsuo lifted his rifle easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness 
Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills 
They had fought from caves and the marines resorted to burning them out 
Even now like a ringing in his ears he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows 
A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo his friend and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet his uniform blazing 
The marines let him advance 
When he sank on his knees they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy 
Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses both the burned and the unburned the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun 
The callous marines had laughed at each other's retching while stacking bodies 
Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea 
At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle reeking of death 
Apprehensively he peered to the left to the right into the leafy vine-crisscrossed maze 
He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow with the one left to distract him 
He strained his hearing 
Cautious feet stepping on leafmold 
faint creaking of belts and slings 
whispers he heard none of these 
Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird 
Because he couldn't hear them he was more convinced they were there 
A spectacle occurred across the meadow the lone marine took a seat on the ground 
leaning sidewise on a tree trunk he embraced it 
Humiliation made Matsuo tremble 
While his comrades cocked the trap that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver 
Taking aim at the man's face Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge and then he changed his mind 
He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear and so he aimed above the head 
The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound 
Hush followed 
Like a mischievous boy expecting punishment Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle 
How stupid to give his position away 
The jungle did not retort 
The sitter remained seated hugging the tree 
Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy and insects hummed and birds occasionally called 
Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke 
Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight immediately throwing his hands over his eyes 
He went into a whirling dance a sort of blind chasing of the tail 
It ended when he tumbled 
but jumping right up he staggered in no particular direction 
He wore no head cover of any kind and more odd had no visible weapon 
With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo's direction crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop 
When he got closer to the tree Matsuo noted the wild look on his face 
The pockets of his jacket bulged 
Hand grenades 
The bobbing head was a poor target so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk 
The marine spun clapping a hand high on his chest and dived forward 
In the hush that followed the echoes Matsuo was tense 
They could come on him now without difficulty 
Gradually he reached a conclusion 
The marine was alone for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree 
Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage 
The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away one arm extended 
Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out 
Reflex 
Rifle leveled on the man he made a rush 
Heat in the sunlight pressed in like an invisible crowd 
He squatted by the head gently placing the rifle on the ground 
With a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair and twisting pulled the marine over on his back 
He was bearded 
The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone 
around the hole blood glistened in a little patch 
Maintaining his clutch on the hair Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets 
In one a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter both sticky from the man's bleeding 
In the other a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief 
One by one he tossed the objects aside 
He didn't smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter 
he had no use any longer for exact time even had the watch been running 
Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief 
Too bad the marine had no water 
From its holder he took his own canteen 
The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure 
The marine's eyes opened squeezed shut then opened squinted in the glare 
So alive 
Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips 
The marine reached up a hand 
Matsuo shook his head 
None for you 
The marine blinked soon dropping his hand 
Not only had he no canteen but he lacked even the belt to hang one on 
You came well equipped to die 
Some odor made him lean over the man 
He sniffed and recognized it 
Sake 
So that had been his difficulty 
Drunk on sake he must have wandered off from his bivouac 
The marine tried to roll on his right side and moaned 
When he rolled on the left side propping on his left elbow Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over 
Be a good turtle 
Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle 
The smell of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his thoughts 
In the caves with other supplies they had kept cases of sake 
The marine shut his eyes 
Are you a thrower of flame marine 
Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground out of the marine's reach and away from their shadows 
He waited in his squat gripping the hair 
Every so often he turned the knife 
Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight 
The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping 
Wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an oily film 
The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes 
Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle 
He must have saturated himself in the drink for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze 
Matsuo shook his head 
Strange 
At last he reached for the knife 
Even the bone handle scorched and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief to wrap it 
First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes 
The marine yelled and flung the hand away 
With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek 
A shrill yelp kicked legs and groping hands that circled Matsuo's wrist 
Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat 
burned the other cheek 
burned each hand when they came groping again 
The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment 
Matsuo stood up 
A small measure of payment marine 
He dropped the knife in its scabbard hung the rifle behind a shoulder 
The marine hands on cheeks rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach 
He ceased weeping 
Matsuo walked toward his tree once glancing back 
The marine was still 
He would soon die 
As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow 
What now 
In the jungle birds were mute while insects preserved only the monotony of living 
Someone called 
It was the marine head lifted he strained and called 
Then he astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat 
He cupped his mouth and yelled 
Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder 
Once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die 
He aimed but listened 
It sounded as if the man were calling him Hey Japanese hey there Japanese 
The man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container 
He performed the act twice more and the begging in his tone grew more distinct 
Sake 
Matsuo called 
The marine nodded vigorously 
Matsuo laughed slung the rifle 
The marine was a winehead 
His superiors had said that all marines were depraved 
The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol 
Remembering his own thirst Matsuo took out his water bottle 
One swallow was all he would have 
he was very thirsty but he must observe water discipline 
His years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline 
He began to uncap the bottle the rusty cap squealing on its threads 
Popping upright the marine waved both hands and shouted 
Of course it was water he really craved 
down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out 
The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack 
Matsuo shook his head 
He had no water for an enemy 
And when this was gone he hadn't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool 
He capped the bottle and replaced it 
After all he had less reason to desire it than the marine 
Before much longer the marine quieted down 
His head slumped 
The upper part of his packet had stained dark 
Marine 
There is nothing for you Matsuo said 
Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion besides the dishonor of it 
I've nothing for you 
From the convulsive quivers of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping 
He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China 
In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform smudged blood-specked with the village burning about him and shells exploding 
Chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar 
Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were 
Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar elbows supporting his massive frame 
He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed 
Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town boys 
He asked 
Seems to me I don't remember altering any law about that 
He straightened up alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer 
Stay right here where you are kid he called 
I don't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I'm a-drinking 
The stranger ignored him 
He didn't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his revolver 
I'm Billy Tilghman said the stranger and I've come for Pat Conyers' body 
And what makes you think you're going to get it pretty boy 
Because I'm asking 
Most of the time I get what I ask for 
Blue Throat winked at his six cronies 
The kid has no manners boys 
Shall we teach him some 
His gun was half drawn when he asked the question but the weapon never left its holster 
Tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin 
His head snapped round and he reeled back crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling 
Tilghman leapt on to him dragged him upright and hit him again this time sending him careening against the bar 
A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman's stomach as Blue Throat's henchmen started shooting 
Tilghman flung himself aside dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun 
The Colt roared twice and two men dropped writhing 
A third shot doused the light 
Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled You all right Billy 
Yes George but I ain't got poor old Pat's body yet 
And I aim to have it 
He fired again and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed 
Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor 
OK Tilghman I'm quitting 
And me said another Blue Throat henchman 
Somebody brought a light 
Tilghman and his partner George Rust herded the men into a corner 
And now said Tilghman with deadly calm I'll repeat what I said 
I've come for Pat Conyers' body 
In two minutes the body of Tilghman's former comrade who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial 
Blue Throat nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride rode out of town with the survivors of the fight 
That critter will be back tomorrow predicted George Rust and he'll bring fifty of his kind back with him 
Blue Throat won't stand for this 
He'll shoot up the town 
The prediction was correct 
The Reverend James Doran had scarcely completed Pat Conyers' last rites on Boot Hill in the township of Petrie when shots were heard in the distance 
Amen said the Reverend Doran grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone and now my brethren it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere 
Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle 
Blue Throat who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship 
It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring ruthless gun-slinger and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it 
He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street 
The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn 
Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire 
The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster's Store halfway down the street 
Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived 
He sized up the situation and shook his head 
If Blue Throat has his way he'll keep us all cooped up in here for days he said 
There's only one thing to move him fast and we have it right here in this very store 
He called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom 
Billy returned with six sticks of dynamite 
I'm gonna drop these into Blue Throat's lap he announced and I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window 
He slipped outside hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways 
Blue Throat's men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed 
Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back 
Here he couldn't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang 
All he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through 
Billy Tilghman did just that 
Within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters with every outlaw either dead or injured inside 
It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat's dictatorship in Petrie 
Though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts 
To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet 
Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the Old West Uncle Billy Tilghman stands out head and shoulders 
He was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book 
He saw the most action beat up more badmen with his bare fists broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other U.S. marshal who lived before or after him 
For fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West 
The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the West have remained almost unsung 
Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century 
He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890's 
Led by Bill Doolin these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks making liberal use of their guns 
Bill Doolin's ambition it appeared was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him 
Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang 
They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw kept him supplied with guns and ammunition harbored his men in their houses 
Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers named Ed Dunn who lived at Rock Fort 
On a bitterly cold day in January 1895 accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn's ranch 
It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside 
The only evidence of occupation came from the chimney which was belching out thick smoke 
The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door 
Wait here Neal said Tilghman 
If I don't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse 
Leaving his rifle in the wagon Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it 
There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside 
Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day 
Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher Ed Dunn 
Hello Ed said Tilghman 
The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn't move 
Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire 
Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck 
Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks each one screened off with a curtain 
And projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles all trained on Billy Tilghman 
The fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide 
Thinking fast Tilghman never hesitated for one instant 
He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him 
The men behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang every man a killer 
Cold day said Tilghman placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire 
Just dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives 
Can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow 
The rancher was trembling 
He wouldn't look Tilghman in the face 
Follow the river for five miles he said hoarsely 
Jed's homestead is on the south bank 
Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes 
All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body 
One false move on his part and he would be a dead man 
Well he announced Guess I'll be going now Ed and thanks for the warmup 
He strolled back to the door whistling softly hands still clasped behind him 
He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive 
But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon 
If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly 
Leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown 
Don't say or do anything he said softly 
Just get out of here without it looking as though we're in a hurry 
That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang 
Even as he spoke those words Billy Tilghman's life hung on a thread 
Back in the house a hoodlum named Red Buck sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then 
You'll stay right here commanded Bill Doolin covering Red with his rifle 
Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back 
We'll let him go 
But the fighting marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell Oklahoma where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets 
Wiley Lynn a self-styled prohibition officer had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since 
That night he reeled out of Ma Murphy's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver 
For several months now Jack Carter a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them had been haunted by a dream a vision of a Woman 
This Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face but she radiated warmth a sweet warmth 
she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately 
When she would do these things he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach 
Then he would run to the toilet behind the house 
Sometimes he did this three or four times a day for this Woman was almost always with him 
He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him 
But they never said anything so he figured it was all right 
And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade the Woman of Jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure 
He could not keep his eyes off her when at school 
when he went home at night he took her with him in his mind and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do 
When he awoke in the mornings she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh 
Miss Langford her first name was Evelyn was an attractive girl 
Tall blonde blue-eyes fair buxom without being heavy she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh starched summer dress 
Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her too it may have been there for a good while since she was twenty now 
but if it had been it had been smothered until now by fear you could tell it by the way she watched the older bigger boys like Jack 
She would look at Jack with that hidden something in her eyes and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick 
School began in August the hottest part of the year and for the first few days Miss Langford was very lenient with the children letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another 
The first two or three days they went home early 
All that is except Jack 
He hung around the schoolhouse watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order 
Once this was on the third day of school she kneeled down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg 
He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating 
About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him he thought although probably she didn't even see him 
He jumped back ducked and ran crouching down the hill away from the school 
He didn't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath 
then he slowed to a walk 
The vision became even stronger now 
I'll get her yet he muttered to himself 
I've got to get her 
That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion in which he and the Woman now the teacher did everything except engage in the act and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire 
He ate litle that morning and his mother became concerned inasmuch as he usually ate heartily 
What's the matter honey 
She said with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child 
Aren't you hungry 
No I'm not hungry he said pushing back the bacon and eggs 
Outside it was already hot at 7:30 A.M. and it was getting hot in the kitchen 
He felt a little sick at his stomach 
Are you sick 
No he said 
I'll be all right 
I guess it's this hot weather 
Don't you play hard today then 
And if you get sick ask the teacher to let you come home early 
Daddy left the car for me and I'm going to town this afternoon 
OK. I won't play hard he promised 
Just then Charles Lever yelled Hey Jack from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door yelling Good-bye Mom over his shoulder 
Whaddya say boy 
Charles said grinning showing his huge yellow teeth 
Charles also fifteen was tall and skinny scraggly with straight black hair like an Indian's and sharp brown eyes 
He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him 
You know what I done last night 
Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school 
Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty because girls were Charles' only apparent interest 
But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles' revelations even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention so he usually invited them as he did now 
No 
What 
I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry 
A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind 
His heart beat faster 
Hell you say 
He said lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles 
How'd you do it 
Hell I jist got on top of 
No I mean how'd you get her to do it 
Hell I jist ask her 
Jist like that 
Hell yes 
She's been hangin' around me a lot here lately and I figgered I might as well's try it 
Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it 
I never heard that 
It's all over Branchville 
If you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself 
I might try it one of these days Jack said wonderingly thinking of Miss Langford 
When they reached the school a gang of boys and girls were already there playing crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse 
Miss Langford in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals without socks was out there with them trying to get them inside 
Time for books she yelled jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand 
Let's go inside 
Oh come on Miss Langford play with us just onct one of the little girls begged smiling wistfully 
No not now said the teacher 
Maybe at dinner time 
Come inside now 
The children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse 
Jack watched Miss Langford all morning 
He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider 
Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress sitting in the sixth-grade row and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did 
At noontime remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys except Charles went off out the road to play ball 
Why ain't you playin' ball 
He asked Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse 
Miss Langford come out and play with us like you promised several of the little girls called 
I'd druther stay here and watch the girls Charles grinned 
Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress 
Maybe Jack said idly watching for Miss Langford 
Presently she came out of the schoolhouse 
When she appeared two or three of the little girls jumped up and down yelling Goody goody 
Let's play with 'em Jack said rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants 
O.K. Charles rose also and the two of them moved over to join the girls 
They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap 
Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls Jack in the middle of the line gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards sitting down hard her dress flying over her head 
While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again Jack ran over offered her his hand and said Gosh I'm sorry Miss Langford 
I didn't mean to pull so hard 
That's all right she said tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes 
It was my fault 
With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with the other 
When her hand touched his fire went through Jack and he felt weak but he managed somehow to get her on her feet 
He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go 
Thank you she said dusting herself off 
Will you play with us again Miss Langford 
One of the little girls said 
No more today 
Maybe some other day 
Oh shucks the girl said 
I don't believe I'll play any more neither 
Me neither others said and soon the game broke up the children going off in pairs in larger groups and alone 
Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun past Robert Allen's three-room tarpapered house toward the field where the other boys were playing ball thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes 
When he came back to the schoolhouse his mind was made up 
He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class 
That should do it he thought because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work 
He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school 
The only drawback now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work too and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack 
But I've got to take a chance on it he told himself desperately 
To his surprise his plan worked perfectly 
All right if you can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out Miss Langford said firmly not smiling 
You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems 
And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed going home 
He scarcely saw them 
His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child How will I do it 
On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise 
She munched little ginger cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck 
The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman 
Lithe and muscular he had well-molded features and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family 
The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured Look at your watch Col. Garvier 
It is almost time for and calinda to begin 
Col. Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans' most important and enlightened slave owners 
He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start 
The slaves ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name 
Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum 
He showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy 
The drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds 
The dance was of Haitian origin 
The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows 
He was possessive in his manner and though a slave obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners 
He proudly wore the blue livery of her house for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie wife of the prominent surgeon Dr. Louis Lalaurie who bore one of the South's oldest and most cherished names 
Delphine was a pace-setter in high society 
She was a top horsewoman and one of the city's most gracious hostesses 
Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell she also was a sadist a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil 
Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders 
The slender handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves 
He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race 
But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his master's plantation in Bayou St. John 
Shy actually he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields in carriages and in boathouses 
This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near 
The woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection 
What is your name boy 
Come a bit closer 
I won't bite you know 
He gaped at Madame Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris perfume which emanated from her 
Then he smiled shyly 
My name is Dandy Brandon missy 
I belong to Master Alexander Prieur 
She said with intense feeling Come near let me feel your arms 
You look quite strong and healthy to me Dandy 
Mrs. Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage 
Lifting her skirts she climbed in never relinquishing her grip on his arm 
The woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor 
Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees 
Satisfied at last and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts she opened the window and called to her liveried driver 
This was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling shaggy eyebrows 
Aristide 
I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase 
There's $600 in gold in this chamois sack 
If the old fool argues about the price tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer 
Prieur has gout and depends on Louis' pills and bleedings 
Besides he owns 300 slaves 
One less shouldn't matter to him 
Aristide Devol the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native Sierra Leone smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat 
His bold eyes raked the woman and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner 
Another youth Madame 
The coachman said softly 
This one is a tender chicken oui 
Such delicate beauty such fine flesh 
It will rip and shred easily for Madame 
Be quiet Devol 
You are forgetting your place 
The tall coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur 
Delphine Lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove Dandy Brandon cowering in the back seat of the carriage to her mansion at 677 Perdido Street 
Dr. Louis Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion 
Dandy curiosity overcoming his apprehensions peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle 
He saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head 
Dr. Lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses 
He was about 50 years old 
Another young man my dear 
Really you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself he said frowning with displeasure 
Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster 
Dandy is to be our house guest Louis 
I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad quite precocious in many ways 
He deserves a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation 
Quite so my dear 
His room will be ready shortly 
The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave 
Had Dandy been older or wiser instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries' tender care if he valued his life 
But he liked the smell of Delphine's perfume 
Besides her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth 
Also he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony 
So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home 
Airless and dingy though it was the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St. John 
He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie after closing the door showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber 
It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening for the room was to become his prison cell 
When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street he was carried out in a coroner's basket 
Just six weeks after Dandy Brandon's arrival at the mansion the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball to which only New Orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited 
A stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms and Delphine circulated graciously among her guests chatting airily of the forthcoming races the latest fashions from Paris and Louisiana politics 
Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs a despairing boyish shriek and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase 
It was Dandy Brandon clad only in a bloody loincloth emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him 
The lad's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts 
His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition 
Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted Evil woman 
You did this you like to hurt to beat people I want to go home 
These were the last words he ever uttered 
Convulsively he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore 
Dr. Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead 
The ball broke up in confusion 
Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures 
Delphine stood like stone her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse 
But at the coroner's inquest Delphine told a forthright story 
I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry for him 
It was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest 
After I paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy I brought him home but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night 
How he returned in such a ghastly condition or why I cannot say 
Dr. Lalaurie and I didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs 
She daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion That poor boy 
He must have fallen in with evil companions for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced 
Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die 
Such a pitiful end 
Though the slave's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's panel Dandy's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded 
The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady 
Moreover runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans' dives 
So the verdict was death at the hands of a person or persons unknown and the elite of the city accepting Delphine's testimony welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold 
Once again life went its serene way soirees fox hunts balls and dinners 
The excitement over Brandon's bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital 
Then on July 2 there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip 
Mrs. Victor Dominique socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight 
The manservant Devol and his mistress Delphine Lalaurie were pursuing a young girl an octoroon of cameo-like beauty across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion 
The girl was not more than 16 
She was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back 
The bleeding girl was tiring fast 
the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street 
The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice Help me somebody 
They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw 
Bastards he would say all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff and the first chair clobbered me 
Since then and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent and even indecent group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper 
There ain't nothin' faster or lonelier or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wanna go someplace Feathertop would say 
The accommodations may not be the poshest but man 
There ain't nobody askin' for your ticket stub neither 
He had been conning the freights for a long long time now 
Ever since the hooch and the trouble with the Quartet and Midge and the child 
Ever since all that 
It had been a very long time that had no form and no end 
He was as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own riding the dark train out 
Out and out and never to return again 
Till one day the last freight had been jumped the last pint had been killed the last beat had been rapped 
That was the day it ended 
The freight car was cold early in the morning 
He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina 
He held his elbows away from his body and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly 
The train slowed at a road crossing and the big door slid open 
at first gratingly caught by grains of corn then with a clash into its slot 
The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor 
She pulled her legs up under her to rise her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs and Feathertop's music pfffted away 
Now that is a very nice a very nice he murmured to himself back in his corner 
A little thing but the right twist for the action that counted 
Hot that was the word hot 
Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow's wings with the sun shining down over them 
A poet yet 
His thoughts for the swanlike neck the full high breasts the slim waist and the long legs were less than poetic however 
Zingggg-O 
Then the boy straight-armed himself up twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting 
He was less to see but Feathertop took him in too just to keep the records straight 
Curly hair high cheekbones wide gnomelike mouth a pair of drummer's blocky hands and a body that said well maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes but then I'm finished 
We made it Cappy the chick said 
Yeah seems so don't it the boy laughed hugging her close 
Ah-ah 
Feathertop interrupted standing up brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants 
None of that 
We run a respectable house here 
They whirled and saw him standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall 
He was big and filthy and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes 
He held the black plastic kazoo lightly 
Come sit said Feathertop motioning them toward him 
That crap is softer over here 
The girl smiled and started forward 
The boy yanked her back hard tugging her off her feet and gathered her into the crook of his arm 
Now stay with me Kitty he snapped irritably 
I vowed to take care of you and that's what I'm gonna do 
We don't know this guy 
Oooo square bit Feathertop screwed his face up 
This guy was strictly from Outsville 
But nowhere 
What is with this vow jazz 
Feathertop inquired lounging against the freight's vibrating wall 
We we eloped Cappy said 
His head came up and he said it defiantly 
Well congratulations 
Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand 
These two were going to be easy pickins 
They couldn't have much dough but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much 
And besides the chick had a little something the others didn't have 
That was gonna be fun collecting 
But not just yet 
Feathertop was a connoisseur 
He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it 
Come sit he repeated motioning to the piled hay bags over the pig leavings 
I'm just a poor ex-jazz man name of uh Boyd Smith 
He grinned at them wolfishly 
That ain't your name Mister the boy accused 
And you know you're right 
Feathertop aimed a finger at him 
Oh come on Cappy the girl chided 
He's okay 
He's a nice guy 
She started to move toward the hay bags dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her 
Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim trim legs as she walked to the bags and tucked them beneath her smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle 
He cleared his throat 
it had been a long hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance 
He had it all doped of course 
Slug the kid grab his dough at least enough to get to Philadelphia and then have a rockin' ball with the doll 
Hmm diddle 
Where'd you come from Mr. uh Mr. Smith 
Kitty inquired politely 
Where from 
He mused 
Out 
I been riding train for a ways now 
They lapsed into silence and the freight wallowed up a hill scooted down the other side shaking and clanking to itself 
After a while Kitty murmured something to Cappy and he held her close answering We'll just have to wait till we pull into Philly honey 
What's the matter she wanna go the bathroom 
Ernie found it immensely funny 
The boy scowled at him and the girl looked shocked 
No 
Certainly not I mean no that isn't what I said 
She snapped at him 
I only said I was hungry 
We haven't had anything to eat all day 
Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill's voice as he reached behind him pulling out a battered carpet bag with leather handles 
Whyn't ya say so fellow travelers 
Why we got dinner right here 
C'mon buddy help me set up the kitchen and we'll have food in a minute or two 
Cappy looked wary but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar 
Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag 
He took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal a deep pot of thin metal some sheets of newspaper a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it 
He put the charcoal in the pot lit the paper with the matches and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot 
A charcoal pit man he said indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier 
Fan it he told Cappy handing him a sheet of newspaper 
Yeah but what're we gonna eat 
Charcoal 
Fella Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man you try my ever-lovin' patience 
He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners 
Hot dogs man 
Not the greatest but they stick to your belly insides 
He ripped down the cellophane carefully and laid three dogs on the tin foil 
Almost immediately they began to sizzle 
He looked up and grinned 
A Kroger's self-serve he explained 
I self-served 
When they had licked the last of the wieners' taste from their fingers they settled back and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette 
Nice kid Ernie thought too bad 
How come you're riding the rods kids like you 
Ernie asked 
Cappy looked down at his wide hands and did not reply 
But surprisingly Kitty's face came up and she said My father 
He didn't want us to get married 
So we ran away 
Why didn't he want you to get hitched 
This time even she did not answer 
She looked down at her hands too 
After a few seconds she said Dad didn't like Cappy 
It was my fault 
Cappy's head came around sharply 
Your fault hell 
It was all my fault 
If I'd been careful it never woulda he stopped abruptly 
Ernie's eyebrows went up 
What's the matter 
The girl still did not raise her eyes but she added simply I'm pregnant 
Cappy raged at himself 
Oh he was stupid her old man 
You never heard nothin' like it Kitty's gonna go have an abortion and Kitty's gonna go away to a convent and Kitty's this and Kitty's that like he was nuts or somethin' y'know 
Ernie nodded 
This was a slightly different matter 
He remembered Midge and the child 
But that had been a time before all this a time he didn't think about 
A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out 
But these kids weren't like him 
Oh crap 
He thought Pull out of it old son 
These are just another couple of characters to roll 
What they got you get 
Now forget all this other 
Wanna drink 
Ernie offered taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket 
Yeah 
Now that you offer 
The answer came from the open door of the boxcar 
From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside as the train had slowed on the grade 
Ernie stared at the man 
He was big 
Real big with shoulders out to here and hair all over him like a grizzly 
Road gang Ernie thought 
You gonna give me a drink fella 
The big man asked again taking a step into the boxcar 
Ernie hesitated a moment 
This character could break him in half 
Sure he said and lifted the pint to his own lips 
He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder 
The man stalked toward them his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring 
He took the bottle with undue belligerence and making sucking noises with his thick lips drained it completely 
He threw his head back closed his eyes and belched ferociously 
He belched again and opening his eyes threw the bottle out the open door 
Well now he said and reached into his pocket 
I didn't know I was gonna have company in this car 
We're going to Philadelphia Kitty said pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more 
No I don't think so said the big man and it was the final clincher for Ernie 
He had suspected this guy was trouble and now he was sure of it 
Maybe you and me will girlie but these two ain't goin' nowhere 
He advanced on them and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car 
Ernie was screaming inside himself No damn you you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me 
The newcomer stalked toward them and Kitty shied back her hand to her mouth 
Her scream split up the silence of the car accompanied by the rattling of the freight and then Cappy came off the floor his legs driving him hard 
The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump 
And carried him backward in a footballer's tackle 
They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs 
The kid showed for an instant and his arm was cocked back 
The fist went down into the pile of flesh and Ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go Aaawww 
Then they were tumbling again and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier and came up with a vicious switchblade 
He held the knife aloft an instant an instant enough to press the stud 
The blade came out with a snick 
He fisted the knife overhand and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat 
Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white 
She grabbed at Feathertop's sleeve and shrieked Help him 
Help him 
Do something 
Northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration 
They have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state 
And both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons 
The name presumably derives from the French royal house which never learned and never forgot 
since Bourbon whiskey though of Kentucky origin is at least as much favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South 
The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North 
The race problem has tended to obscure other less emotional issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive 
It is these other differences between North and South other that is than those which concern discrimination or social welfare which I chiefly discuss herein 
I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience 
A Southerner married to a New Englander I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists writers publicity men and business executives of egghead tastes 
Most of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves and are viewed as liberals 
This is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson who held that the best government was the least government 
Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints 
When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy I find that they fall into two categories the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis 
and the intelligent cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things don't count any more in the world of to-day 
I am naive they say to make use of such words 
I take this to mean that the intelligent and therefore necessarily cynical 
liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it 
This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which under a President of the same stamp would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court 
As for states' rights they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms 
The American liberal may in the world of to-day have a strong case 
but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one 
Why in the first place call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody 
If he attaches little importance to personal liberty why not make this known to the world 
And if he is so scornful of the rights of states why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support 
I am concerned here however with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South 
It appears to be one of intense dislike which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends 
His assumption seems to be that any such friends being tolerable humans must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views 
Time's editor Thomas Griffith in his book The Waist-High Culture wrote most of what was different about it the Deep South I found myself unsympathetic to 
This for the liberals I know would be an understatement 
Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism 
I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North 
In business circles usually conservative this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found 
But in our case and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration nor are we given to emotional outbursts the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more 
In fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down 
Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up against segregationist prejudice especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view 
But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee-hatred displayed in social gatherings 
From my wife's experience and other sources this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles 
The strong feeling is certainly there 
but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South especially among those who studied in the North 
And social relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy if not sympathy toward resident and visiting Northerners 
Also among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems 
There are of course many Souths 
but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who haven't 
My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War 
Nobody knows how many Southerners there are in this category 
I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to believe 
I never heard of a poll being taken on the question 
No doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic 
Prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy 
Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is more doubtful 
and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old South 
Belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones 
Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere with Georgia North Carolina and Alabama following along after them 
Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont 
so that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old South from the new but with of course important minority enclaves 
The long-settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering and there the memory is more precious and the consciousness of loss the greater 
Also we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies than with the North even after independence 
The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area 
In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South 
Poor where they had once been rich humbled where they had been arrogant having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country 
And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown 
Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors 
All Southerners agree that slavery had to go 
but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did 
Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending the invasion and Reconstruction 
their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties 
But apart from racial problems the old unreconstructed South to use the moderate words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North 
And this in effect means most of modern America 
It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise 
And therein I feel many Northerners delude themselves about the South 
For one thing this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed 
There seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it 
I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful thinking don't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and they will take care of themselves 
Or else the North really believes that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past and are now at heart sharers of the American Dream like everybody else 
If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true 
The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western world 
Regardless of rights and wrongs a population and an area appropriate to a pre-World-War- 1 great power have been following conquest ruled against their will by a neighboring people and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike 
And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent 
This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination 
The fact is due mainly to international wars both hot and cold 
In every war of the United States since the Civil War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country 
So instead of being tests of the South's loyalty the Spanish War the two World Wars and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion 
And there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism 
Had the situation been reversed had for instance England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England there is little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain 
It is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have 
The North should thank its stars that such has been the case 
but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom 
The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries 
There is much truth in both these charges and not many Bourbons deny them 
Whatever their faults they are not hypocrites 
Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure 
Many Northeners believe this too but few of them will say so publicly 
The Bourbon economic philosophy moreover is not very different from that of Northern conservatives 
But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this 
They believe that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America 
As it is they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism that in spite of its high standard of living the American way has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter 
The South's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners harsh accents lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure 
Their own easier slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners 
and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town 
In the past the duties of the state as Sir Henry Maine noted long ago were only two in number internal order and external security 
By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders 
Outside those limits it asserted as against other states a position of sovereign equality and as against the inferior peoples of the non-Western world a position of dominance 
It became the sole subject of international law a term which it is pertinent to remember was coined by Bentham a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western nations could do in the world arena 
That corpus of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
Speaking generally it furthered and still tends to further the interests of the Western powers 
The enormous changes in world politics have however thrown it into confusion so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era 

Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility either internally or externally 
This was particularly true in the world arena which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires 
That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman 
His duty was to his sovereign and to his nation and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated 
Thus to cite but one example the Pax Britannica of the nineteenth century whether with the British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling world finance was strictly national in motivation however much other nations e.g. the United States may have incidentally benefited 
At the same time all suggestions that some sort of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resisted 
Social Darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century 
However in recent decades for what doubtless are multiple reasons an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occurred in both facets of national activity 
A concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment 
Already firmly implanted internally it is a growing factor in external matters 
A little more than twenty years ago the American people turned an important corner 
In what has aptly been called a constitutional revolution the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature the night-watchman state to one with affirmative duties to perform 
The positive state came into existence 
For lawyers reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences there has been a special fascination since then in the role played by the Supreme Court in that transformation the manner in which its decisions altered in the switch in time that saved nine President Roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious Court-packing plan the imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation 
Of greater importance however is the content of those programs which have had and are having enormous consequences for the American people 
Labor relations have been transformed income security has become a standardized feature of political platforms and all the many facets of the American version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom 
A national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary 
Ratified in the Republican Party victory in 1952 the Positive State is now evidenced by political campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be 
The general acceptance of the idea of governmental i.e. societal responsibility for the economic well-being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in American constitutional history 
The other of course was the Civil War the conflict which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation 
A third one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance is now being traversed American immersion and involvement in world affairs 
Internal national responsibility now a truism need not be documented 
Nevertheless it may be helpful to cite one example that of employment for as will be shown below it cuts across both facets of the new concept 
Thirty years ago while the nation was wallowing in economic depression the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow natural forces to operate and cure the distress 
That guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal 
less than a score of years later Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946 by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment 
Hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning the economic side of the constitutional revolution 
In 1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a state's-responsibility proposal provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus 
The American people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 
Internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the Industrial Revolution 
Reduced to its simplest terms it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals to cope with the rigors of the era 
National responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United States or even to the Western nations 
A measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists in 1959 
Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International Commission of Jurists a body of lawyers from the free world the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law to include affirmative governmental duties 
It is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed former colonial nations 
The Rule of Law historically a principle according everyone his day in court before an impartial tribunal was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare 
Recognizing that the Rule of Law is a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility to establish social economic educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized 
The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world 
For better or for worse we all now live in welfare states the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well-being 
Whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish 
The hypothesis ventured here is that it does and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition 
The content is not the same however rather than individual security it is the security and continuing existence of an ideological group those in the free world that is basic 
External national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the Western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations 
If internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism 
Reference to two other concepts nationalism and sovereignty may help to reveal the contours of the new principle 
In its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself internally against feudal groups and externally against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church 
The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led not more than two centuries ago to the surge of nationalism 
Since the time-span of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence of the United States as an independent entity it is perhaps natural for Americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order something permanent and unchanging 
The concept of nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure 
But it is more than that 
For it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit 
Today as new nations rise from the former colonial empires nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in the world 
Almost febrile in intensity the principle has become worldwide in application unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm 
Historically however the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the Western civilizational group 
By subduing disparate lesser groups the nation has to some degree at least broadened the capacity for individual liberty 
Within their confines moreover technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace thus increasing the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied 
While the pattern is uneven some having gained more than others nationalism has in fact served the Western peoples well 
Whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world and whether today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects are other questions 

It is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation-state attained its highest number approximately 100 
But it is more than irony one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet 
In other words nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application both as to geography and as to population 
it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis 
Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty 
The former receives its legitimacy from the latter 
Operating side by side together they helped shore up the nation-state 
While sovereignty has roots in antiquity in its present usage it is essentially modern 
Jean Bodin writing in the sixteenth century may have been the seminal thinker but it was the vastly influential John Austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood 
Austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking 
To him law is the command of the sovereign the English monarch who personifies the power of the nation while sovereignty is the power to make law i.e. to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations 
These fundamental ideas the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual internal-external aspects still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power 
The nation-state then exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control 
In fact however both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined 
High-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision 
That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies in which popular sovereignty is said to exist and in federal nations in which the jobs of government are split 
Nevertheless nationalism and sovereignty are reputed in the accepted wisdom to describe the modern world 
Is there a different reality behind the facade 
Does the surface hide a quite different picture 
The short answer to those questions is yes 
Both concepts are undergoing alteration 
to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility 
As evidence to support that view consider the following illustrative instances 
Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident 
What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents 
Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster 
Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety 
Will the danger increase or decrease 
I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon in the White House in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as Sherwood Forest 
I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming where officers who wear sidearms are manning the commit buttons that could start a war accidentally or by design and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons 
To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits submarine compartments and the antiseptic windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars the questions seem farfetched 
There is unceasing pressure but its sources are immediate 
Readiness exercises are almost continuous 
Each could be the real thing 
In the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since E hour 
E stands for execution the moment a go order would unleash an American nuclear strike 
There is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks 
They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels switches flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines 
They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details 
Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks 
Among the policy makers generals physicists psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their hardware the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call scenarios 
As an Air Force psychiatrist put it You can't have dry runs on this one 
The experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred probably never will but possibly might 
Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men The more highly placed they are that is the more they know the more concerned they have become 
Already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security 
Only recently new holes were discovered in our safety measures and a search is now on for more 
Work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons 
Meanwhile the experts speak of wars triggered by false pre-emption escalation unauthorized behavior and other terms that will be discussed in this report 
They inhabit a secret world centered on go codes and gold phones 
Their conversations were almost invariably accompanied by the same gestures arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions 
One arm represented our bombers and missiles the other arm theirs 
Yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions perhaps hundreds of millions perhaps you and me and the experts 
These men are not callous 
It is their job to think about the unthinkable 
Unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us and more Russians and Communist Chinese too thought about accidental war 
The first systematic thinking about this Pandora's box within Pandora's boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle a frail meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist 
He was and is with the RAND Corporation a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the U.S. Air Force 
His investigations made him the Paul Revere of accidental war and safety procedures were enormously increased 
In recent weeks as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the Kennedy Administration basic United States strategy has been modified and large new sums allocated to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible 
The chain starts at BMEWS Ballistic Missile Early Warning System in Thule Greenland 
Its radar screens would register Soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States 
BMEWS intelligence is simultaneously flashed to NORAD North American Air Defense Command in Colorado Springs Colorado for interpretation 
to the SAC command and control post forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha Nebraska 
to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President 
Telephones Teletypes several kinds of radio systems and in some cases television link all vital points 
Alternate locations exist for all key command centers 
For last-ditch emergencies SAC has alternate command posts on KC-135 jet tankers 
Multiple circuits routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible 
The same principle of redundancy applies to all communications on these special networks 
And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance by special codes that the messages actually come from their purported sources 
Additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications 
Only the President is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons 
That's the law 
But what if somebody decides to break it 
The President cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger 
He makes the momentous decision 
Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons 
What if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly coolly decide to clobber the Russians 
What if the President himself in the language of the military goes ape 
Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets without provocation 
Nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers 
However the system is designed ingeniously and hopefully so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war 
Even the President cannot pick up his telephone and give a go order 
Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike the go code 
In an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the gold-phone circuit 
A system of gold actually yellow phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the Secretary of Defense the Joint Chiefs of Staff the SAC commander and other key men 
All can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes 
All could help the President make his decision 
The talk would not be in code but neither would it ramble 
Vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda 
Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from Aj 
If communications work his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order 
For these centers too are on the gold circuit 
They include the Navy's Atlantic Command at Norfolk Virginia which is in contact with the Polaris subs 
NATO headquarters in Europe 
Air Force forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases 
and SAC which controls long-range bombers and Atlas missiles 
Let us look in on one of these nerve centers SAC at Omaha and see what must still happen before a wing of B-52 bombers could drop their Aj 
In a word plenty 
The key man almost certainly would be Col. William W. Wisman SAC's senior controller 
He or his deputy or one of their seven assistants all full colonels mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day 
It is a quiet but impressive room 140 feet long thirty-nine feet wide twenty-one feet high 
Movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information 
And Bill Wisman forty-three a farmer's son from Beallsville Ohio is a quiet but impressive man 
His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown 
His movements and speech are precise clear and quick 
No question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate 
Wisman who has had the chief controller's job for four years calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights switches and buttons 
At least a dozen men some armed are never far away from him 
In front of him is a gold phone 
In emergencies the SAC commander Gen. Thomas Power or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman and his staff 
At General Power's seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone 
General Power would participate in the decision making 
Wisman below would listen in and act 
His consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every SAC aircraft 
He need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left right next to the big red button marked alert 
There are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged 

But Wisman too does not know the go code 
He must take it from the red box 
In point of fact this is a beige box with a bright red door about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to Wisman's right 
The box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon It's real obnoxious 
Now we must become vague for we are approaching one of the nation's most guarded secrets 
The codes in the red box there are several of them covering various contingencies are contained in a sealed X-ray-proof unique device 
They are supplied a batch at a time by a secret source and are continually changed by Wisman or his staff at random intervals 
But even the contents of Wisman's box cannot start a war 
They are mere fragments just one portion of preprepared messages 
What these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed 
The pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman's staff 
In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages again in special codes each message also contains an internal authenticator another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing 
I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one 
I'd wind up full of bullet holes he said and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers 
Now let us imagine a wing of B-52's on alert near their positive control or fail-safe points the spots on the map many miles from Soviet territory beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets 
They too have fragments of the go code with them 
As Wisman put it They have separate pieces of the pie and we have the whole pie 
Once we send out the whole pie they can put their pieces into it 
Unless we send out the whole pie their pieces mean nothing 
Why does Wisman's ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers 
The answer is a cryptographic secret 
At any rate three men out of a six-man B-52 crew are required to copy down Wisman's go-to-war message 
Each must match Wisman's pie with the fragment that he carries with him 
All three must compare notes and agree to go 
After that it requires several minutes of concentrated work including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber each with another man beside him to help for an armed bomb to be released 
Unless all gadgets are properly operated and the wires and seals from the handles removed first no damage can be done 
Suddenly however their posture changed and the game ended 
They went as rigid as black statuary six figures lean and tall and angular went still 
Their heads were in the air sniffing 
They all swung at the same instant in the same direction 
They saw it before I did even with my binoculars 
It was nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth 
In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree no more 
A white man would not have seen it 
The aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos 
Watching they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land 
At once the whole band set off at a lope 
They were chasing a rain cloud 
They went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow 
I followed them in the jeep and now they did not care 
The games were over this was life 
Occasionally for no reason that I could see they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot 
Sometimes I guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction 
Sometimes it was to skirt a gulley 
Their gait is impossible to convey in words 
It has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it it is not a lope it is not done with style or verve 
It is the gait of the human who must run to live arms dangling legs barely swinging over the ground head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful 
It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground 
They ran for three hours 
Finally avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground they intercepted the rain squall 
For ten minutes they ran beneath the squall raising their arms and for the first time shouting and capering 
Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady 
They were studying the ground 
Suddenly one of them shouted ran a few feet bent forward and put his mouth to the ground 
He had found a depression with rain water in it 
He bent down a black cranelike figure and put his mouth to the ground 
With a lordly and generous gesture the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows 
The other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle 
In an instant he had sucked it dry 
The aborigine lives on the cruelest land I have ever seen 
Which does not mean that it is ugly 
Part of it is of course 
There are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous 
They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand 
Such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality 
But much of the land which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable 
It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush has a peaceful quality the hills roll softly 
The malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles Bean 
He tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer 
They went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the outback country 

The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps 
Nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men 
Only there happened nothing 
There might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps only there was not 
It might have rained any time 
only it did not 
There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise 
only there was not 
They lay with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them 
No one came 
The white men died 
And countless others like them have died 
Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction were tortured by the heat driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape and who finally died 
The aborigine is not deceived 
he knows that the land is hard and pitiless 
He knows that the economy of life in the outback is awful 
There is no room for error or waste 
Any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done 
I do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge but I suspect that it can 
Perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity 
The family at the boulder 
seeing an aborigine today is a difficult thing 
Many of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports 
Others are confined to vast reservations and not only does the Australian government justifiably not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo but on their reservations they are extremely fugitive shunning camps coming together only for corroborees at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch which is very low indeed 
I persuaded an Australian friend who had lived outback for years to take me to see some aborigines living in the bush 
It was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language 
Finally however the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover 
We followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth 
The rancher went a mile down this road and then when he reached a big red boulder swung off the road 
At once he started to glance toward the instrument panel 
It took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel there was a gimbaled compass welded to it which rocked gently back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about 
The rancher was navigating his way across the flatland 
Do you always navigate like this 
I asked 
Damned right he said 
Once I get out on the flat I do 
Some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks a tree here a wash here a boulder there 
But if you don't know the place like the palm of your hand you'd better use a compass and the speedometer 
Two miles northeast then five miles southwest that sort of thing 
Very simple 
He was right 
The landscape kept repeating itself 
I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless 
Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines 
They were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder a man his lubra and two children 
The sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade cast by the boulder 
There was also a dog a dingo dog 
Its ribs showed it was a yellow nondescript color it suffered from a variety of sores hair had scabbed off its body in patches 
It lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving watching us carefully 
It struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog 
No one patted the dog 
It was not a pet 
It was a worker 
The buggers love shade the rancher said 
I suppose because it saves them some loss of body water 
They'll move around that rock all day following the shade 
During the hottest part of the day of course the sun comes straight down and there isn't any shade 
We drove close to the boulder stopped the Land Rover and walked over toward the family 
The man was leaning against the rock 
He gazed away from us as we approached 
He was over six feet tall and very thin 
His legs were narrow and very long 
Every bone and muscle in his body showed but he did not give the appearance of starving 
He had long black hair and a wispy beard 
The ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut 
There was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what 
It was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets 
A fly would crawl down the bulging forehead into the socket of the eye walk along the man's lashes and across the wet surface of the eyeball and the eye did not blink 
The Australian and I both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine 
I turned to look at the lubra 
She remained squatting on her heels all the time we were there 
like the man she was entirely naked 
Her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions which were placed in front of her 
There were two rubbing sticks for making fire two stones shaped roughly like knives a woven-root container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead body of some rodent 
There was also a long wooden spear and a woomera a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy 
There was also a boomerang elaborately carved 
Everything was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless 
The two children both boys wandered around the Australian and me for a few moments and then returned to their work 
They squatted on their heels with their heads bent far forward their eyes only a few inches from the ground 
They had located the runway of a colony of ants and as the ants came out of the ground the boys picked them up one at a time and pinched them dead 
The tiny bodies dropped onto a dry leaf made a pile as big as a small apple 
The odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines 
The smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant 
It was also subtly familiar for it was the odor of the human body but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed 
One's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant 
But that is a cliche and a dishonest one 
The smell is sexual but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it 
Their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin 
They roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it 
In spots such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and I realized the aborigines were much darker than they appeared 
as if the coating of sweat dirt and ashes were a cosmetic 
The boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and blinked their eyes 
That smell is something eh mate 
The Australian asked 
They swear that every person smells different and every family smells different from every other 
At the corroborees when they get to dancing and sweating you'll see them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good smell 
Idje here and he nodded at the man is said to have great odor 
The stink is all the same to me but I really think they can make one another out blindfolded 
Here Idje you fella like tabac 
He said sharply 
Idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon 
The Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin I could understand and spoke strange words from deep in his chest 
It was a fortunate time in which to build for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art 
The architects the tile and carpet makers the potters painters calligraphers and metalsmiths worked through Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city 
Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion a great garden filled with nightingales and roses cut by canals and terraced promenades studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes 
At the heart of all of this was the square which one such traveler declared to be as spacious as pleasant and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe 
In time Isfahan came to be known as half the world Isfahan nisf-i-jahan 
In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city then the size of London started to decline 
The Afghans invaded 
the Safavids fell from power 
the capital went elsewhere 
the desert encroached 
Isfahan became more of a legend than a place and now it is for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of old Persia and sometimes of the East 
They think of it as a kind of spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor 
Those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight 
But even for them it remains a museum or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead 
Everyone is ready to grant the Persians their history but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present 
It seems that for Persia and especially for this city there are only two times the glorious past and the corrupt depressing sterile present 
The one apparent connection between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other have survived and which naturally enough are called historical monuments 
However just as all the buildings have not fallen and flowed back to their original mud so the values which wanted them and saw that they were built have not all disappeared 
The values and talents which made the tile and the dome the rug the poem and the miniature continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of this city as the great buildings rise above blank walls and dirty lanes 
Often too the social institutions are housed in these pavilions and palaces and bridges for these great structures are not simply historical monuments 
they are the places where Persians live 
The promenade for example continues to take place on the Chahar Bagh a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees that now serves as the city's principal street 
It takes place as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge and also in the gardens of the square 
On Fridays the day when many Persians relax with poetry talk and a samovar people do not it is true stream into Chehel Sotun a pavilion and garden built by Shah Abbas 2 in the seventeenth century but they do retire into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley which are smaller more humble copies of the former 
And of course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques and commercial life very much a social institution in the bazaar 
Those three other great activities of the Persians the bath the teahouse and the zur khaneh the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics dance chanted poetry and music do not take place in buildings to which entrance tickets are sold but some of them occupy splendid examples of Persian domestic architecture long domed chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile their end walls cut through to the orchards and the sky by open arches 
But more important and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see is that these places and activities are often the settings in which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities 
Water air fruit poetry music the human form these things are important to Persians and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness 
I should like by the way to make it clear that I am not using the word Persians carelessly 
I don't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations like a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool 
These things are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary 
The men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's night are as often as not the lutihaw mustachioed toughs who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons brothels and teahouses 
A few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor 
Not long ago an acquaintance a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw of the city stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks 
The air he said was just right 
a cigarette would taste particularly good 
I really didn't know what he meant 
It was a nice day granted 
But he knew 
he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage 
The natural world then plus poetry and some kinds of art receives from the most ordinary of Persians a great deal of attention 
The line of an eyebrow the color of the skin a ghazal from Hafiz the purity of spring water the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of a pavilion these things are noticed judged and valued 
Nowhere in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the Persians shown so well as during the promenade at the Khaju bridge 
There has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city 
For one thing there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed 
for another it was here that one of the old caravan routes came in 
It was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans and also to make a pleasance for the city that Shah Abbas 2 in about 1657 built of sun-baked brick tile and stone the present bridge 
It is a splendid structure 
From upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river 
from downstream where the water level is much lower it is a high elaborately facaded pavilion 
The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile 
At either end and in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed and capacious as church apses 
Here in the old days when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks sat the king and his court while priests soldiers and other members of the party lounged in the smaller alcoves between 
Below twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge 
These are traversed by another line of vaults and thus rooms arched on all four sides are formed 
Down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise the mountains and river pools 
Here on the hottest day it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the vaults 
On the downstream or pavilion side these vaults give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself 
From the terraces eighteen in all broad flights of steps descend into the water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river 
Out of water brick and tile they have made far more than just a bridge 
On spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge 
It is a great spectacle 
The bridge itself rises up from the river light-flared and enormous like the outdoor set for an epic opera 
Crowds press along the terraces down the steps in and out of the arcades massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege 
All kinds come to walk in the promenade merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal 
a Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket 
dervishes who stand with the stillness of the blind their eyes filmed with rheum and visions 
the old Kajar princes arriving in their ancient limousines 
students civil servants beggars musicians hawkers and clowns 
Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on carpets around a samovar 
Below people line the steps as though on bleachers to watch the sky and river 
Above in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi while at the very bottom in the vaults the toughs and blades of the city hoot and bang their drums drink arak play dice and dance 
Here in an evening Persians enjoy many of the things which are important to them poetry water the moon a beautiful face 
To a stranger their delight in these things may seem paradoxical for Persians chase the golden calf as much as any people 
Many of them moreover are beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant the mullah and the peasant 
Nonetheless they take time out much time from the game of grab and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks 
Above all they will stop in the middle of anything anywhere to hear or quote some poetry 
Poetry in Persian life is far more than a common ground on which in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms all may stand 
It contains in fact their whole outlook on life 
And it is expressed at least to their taste in a perfect form 
Poetry for a Persian is nothing less than truth and beauty 
In most Western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and museums 
In Persia where practically speaking there are no museums or libraries or for that matter hardly any books the twins run free 
It is perhaps difficult to conceive but imagine that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End will gather to sing Marlowe Herrick Shakespeare and perhaps some lyrics of their own 
That at any rate is what happens at the Khaju bridge 
Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade 
Here in these little rooms or stages arched open to the sky and river they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which Persian music is divided 
Each mode is believed to have a specific attribute one inducing pleasure another generosity another love and so on to include all of the emotions 
The singer simply matches the poem to a mode 
for example the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem They brought me news that Spring is in the plains And Ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains 
Go tell his aged mother that her son Fought with a thousand foes and he was one 
Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet Know ye fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall hereafter come to birth That here with dust upon his eyes Iraj the sweet-tongued singer lies 
In this true lover's tomb interred A world of love lies sepulchred 

These songs practically all Persian music for that matter are limited to a range of two octaves 
Yet within this limitation there is an astonishing variety design as intricate as that in the carpet or miniature with the melodic line like the painted or woven line often flowing into an arabesque 
Die Frist ist um und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr the Maestro quoted The Flying Dutchman as he told of his career and wanderings explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several times 
The music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra William Steinberg has molded his group into a prominent musical organization which is his life 
When he added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958 he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months commuting between the two cities 
This schedule became too strenuous even for the energetic and conscientious Mr. Steinberg 
His London contract was rescinded and now he explains cheerfully as a bright smile lightens his intense mobile face I conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts 
Our meeting took place in May 1961 during one of the Maestro's stop-overs in New York before he left for Europe 
As we began to converse in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent 
Seeking an obscure dark relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine he asked if the soft background music could be turned off 
Unfortunately it was Muzak which automatically is piped into the public rooms and which nolens volens had to be endured 
As he talked about himself time and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled 
Did he come from a musical family 
Yes though not professional musicians they were a music-loving family 
In his native Cologne where his mother taught him to play the piano he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet 
She even devised a system of colors whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values 
When he started school at the age of five-and-a-half he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter A instead of C as in the scale 
Because like many other children he intensely disliked practicing Czerny Etudes he composed his own studies 
When he was eight he began violin lessons 
Soon he was playing in the Cologne Municipal Orchestra and during World War 1 when musicians were scarce he joined the opera orchestra as well 
Steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career 
By observing the conductor he says with a twinkle in his eyes I learned how not to conduct 
The musician ran away from school when he was fifteen but this escapade did not save him from the Gymnasium 
Simultaneously he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony as well in the violin and piano 
His professional career began when he was twenty 
he became Otto Klemperer's personal assistant at the Cologne Opera and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor 
Wasn't this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post 
Yes the Maestro assented 
Had he always wished to be a conductor 
No originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such 
However when he assumed the duties of a conductor he relinquished his career as a pianist 
Five years were spent with the Cologne Opera after which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky teacher of Arnold Schonberg and Erich Korngold 
In 1927 he succeeded Zemlinsky as opera director of the German Theater at Prague 
During his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin State Opera 
Two years later he became director of the Frankfurt Opera where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the rise of the Hitler regime 
During these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany 
He had presented the first German performances of Puccini's Manon Lescaut and De Falla's La Vida Breve 
The Frankfurt years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of Berg's Wozzek soon after the Berlin premiere under Erich Kleiber and the world premiere of Schonberg's Von heute auf morgen 
At the outset of his career Steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Schonberg work every year 
In Frankfurt too he directed the Museum and Opera House concerts which in addition to the standard repertoire featured novelties like Erdmann's Piano Concerto and Mahler's Sixth Symphony 
Because of the political upheaval in Germany in the 1930's Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish community 
Through the Frankfurt Jewish Kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann 
As more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt Kulturbund Orchestra which also gave guest performances in other German cities 
In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin Kulturbund 
In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra with Steinberg as founder-conductor 
In 1938 at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini Steinberg left Germany for the United States by way of Switzerland 
After he had spent the first three years in New York as associate conductor at Toscanini's invitation of the NBC Orchestra he made numerous guest appearances throughout the United States and Latin America 
In 1945 he became conductor of the Buffalo Philharmonic 
Seven years later he was asked to become director of the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Since 1944 he has also conducted regularly at the San Francisco Opera where he made his debut with a memorable performance of Verdi's Falstaff 
In recent years he has traveled widely in Europe conducting in Italy France Austria and Switzerland 
He returned to Germany for the first time in 1953 where he has since conducted in Cologne Frankfurt and Berlin 
Where in Europe was he going now 
First of all to Italy for a short vacation Forte Dei Marmi a place he loves 
Since it is not far from Viareggio he will visit Puccini's house as he never fails to do to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of La Boheme which he considers one of Puccini's masterpieces 
Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about Italy Rome is my second home 
I consider it the center of the world and make it a point to be there once a year 
He will conduct two concerts at the Accademia Di Santa Cecilia as well as concerts in Munich and Cologne 
Then I return to the United States for engagements at the Hollywood Bowl and in Philadelphia he added 
The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest 
There will be premieres of new works made possible through Ford Foundation commissions Carlisle Floyd's Mystery with Phyllis Curtin as soprano soloist 
Other world premieres will be Gardner Read's Third Symphony and Burle Marx's Samba Concertante 
And next year we will do also a Ford commission a piano concerto by Elliott Carter with Jacob Lateiner as soloist 
Of course I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner works in the coming season as usual 
We'll play Bruckner's Fifth Symphony in the original version and Mahler's Seventh the least accessible known and played of Mahler's works 
My Pittsburghers have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner 
He added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour especially Mahler's First and Fourth symphonies and Das Lied Von der Erde and Bruckner's Sixth which is rarely played and Seventh 
Bruckner's Eighth he refers to as my travel symphony 
He recalled that in California after a critic had attacked him for still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation 
Now that Bruno Walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend Dimitri Mitropoulos is no longer with us I am probably the only one with the possible exception of Leonard Bernstein who has this special affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner and Mahler 
Since he introduces so much modern music I could not resist asking how he felt about it 
There was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created 
But I usually stick to the old phrase Ich habe ein Amt aber keine Meinung I hold an office but I do not feel entitled to have an opinion 
I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today 
With all his musical activities did he have the time and inclination to do anything else 
He had just paid a brief visit to the Frick Collection to admire his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz Hals 
He was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude Lorrain but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin exhibit he had been able to see in Paris a year ago 
And how did he feel about modern art 
Again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments 
As my wife puts it he said again with a twinkle in his eyes all you know is your music 
But after all you never learned anything else 
What did he do for relaxation 
Like his late colleague Mitropoulos he reads mystery stories in particular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 
He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature 
But his prime interest apart from music he insisted seriously was his family his wife daughter and son 
At the moment he was excited about his son's having received the Prix De Rome in archaeology and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation of an Etruscan tomb 
Both children are musical and my wife is a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgement 
Is the attitude of German youth comparable to that of the angry young men of England 
Was the topic for a round-table discussion at the Bayerische Rundfunk in Munich 
I was chairman the only not youthful participant 
Since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts I added to my opening statement a sentence in which I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather than angry 
I was far from convinced of the truth of my statement but could not think of anything that might evoke responses more quickly 
It is easy for you to talk 
countered a twenty year old law student you travel around the world 
We would like to do that too 
But you want a job guaranteed when you return I continued my attack 
You must have some security said a young clerk 
When I mentioned that for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return fare but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount the young people looked at me doubtingly 
One girl expressed what was obviously in their minds 
Would you advise us to act the same way 
You might have failed 
I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck 
Others mentioned that I might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding 
The debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life what his hopes were and what his fears 
Though the four boys and two girls the youngest nineteen years of age the oldest twenty-four came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests there was surprising agreement among them 
What they wished for most was security 
what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country 
The ideal home they agreed would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms just enough for a family consisting of husband wife and two children 
No one wanted a larger family or no children and none hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory 
All expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest 
Once again as in the days of the Founding Fathers America faces a stern test 
That test as President Kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his State of the Union message will determine whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure 
It is well then that in this hour both of national peril and of national opportunity we can take counsel with the men who made the nation 
Incapable of self-delusion the Founding Fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave and yet they had confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty 
Seven Founders George Washington Benjamin Franklin John Adams Thomas Jefferson Alexander Hamilton James Madison and John Jay determined the destinies of the new nation 
In certain respects their task was incomparably greater than ours today for there was nobody before them to show them the way 
As Madison commented to Jefferson in 1789 We are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us 
Our successors will have an easier task 
They thought of themselves to use Jefferson's words as the Argonauts who had lived in the Heroic Age 
Accordingly they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity 
Their writings assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but rather as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen that with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved 
Strong men with strong opinions frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet the Founding Seven were essentially congenial minds and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences 
Even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation 
Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary 
Certainly no other seven American statesmen from any later period achieved so much in so concentrated a span of years 
Eldest of the seven Benjamin Franklin a New Englander transplanted to Philadelphia wrote the most dazzling success story in our history 
The young printer's apprentice achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields as editor and publisher scientist inventor philanthropist and statesman 
Author of the Albany Plan Of Union which had it been adopted might have avoided the Revolution he fought the colonists' front-line battles in London negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and the peace that ended the war headed the state government of Pennsylvania and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal Convention 
On a military mission for his native Virginia the youthful George Washington touched off the French and Indian War then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia 
Commanding the Continental Army for six long years of the Revolution he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory 
Retiring to his beloved Mount Vernon he returned to preside over the Federal Convention and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected President 
During his two terms the Constitution was tested and found workable strong national policies were inaugurated and the traditions and powers of the Presidential office firmly fixed 
John Adams fashioned much of pre-Revolutionary radical ideology wrote the constitution of his home state of Massachusetts negotiated with Franklin and Jay the peace with Britain and served as our first Vice President and our second President 
His political opponent and lifetime friend Thomas Jefferson achieved immortality through his authorship of the Declaration of Independence but equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted in his native Virginia his role as father of our territorial system and his acquisition of the Louisiana Territory during his first term as President 
During the greater part of Jefferson's career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow Virginian James Madison eight years his junior 
The active sponsor of Jefferson's measure for religious liberty in Virginia Madison played the most influential single role in the drafting of the Constitution and in securing its ratification in Virginia founded the first political party in American history and as Jefferson's Secretary of State and his successor in the Presidency guided the nation through the troubled years of our second war with Britain 
If Franklin was an authentic genius then Alexander Hamilton with his exceptional precocity consuming energy and high ambition was a political prodigy 
His revolutionary pamphlets published when he was only 19 quickly brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders 
Principal author of The Federalist he swung New York over from opposition to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly 
His collaboration with Washington begun when he was the general's aide during the Revolution was resumed when he entered the first Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury 
His bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions 
Less dazzling than Hamilton less eloquent than Jefferson John Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding Fathers 
He served as president of the Continental Congress 
He played the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great Britain that ended the Revolution and directed America's foreign affairs throughout the Confederation period 
As first Chief Justice his strong nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall 
He ended his public career as a two-term governor of New York 
These Seven Founders constituted an intellectual and social elite the most respectable and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed 
Their social status was achieved in some cases by birth as with Washington Jefferson and Jay 
in others by business and professional acumen as with Franklin and Adams or in Hamilton's case by an influential marriage 
Unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals in underdeveloped nations of our own day they commanded both prestige and influence before the Revolution started 
As different physically as the tall angular Jefferson was from the chubby rotund Adams the seven were striking individualists 
Ardent opinionated even obstinate they were amazingly articulate wrote their own copy and were masters of phrasemaking 
Capable of enduring friendships they were also stout controversialists who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens 
John Adams dismissed John Dickinson who voted against the Declaration of Independence as a certain great fortune and piddling genius 
Washington castigated his critic General Conway as being capable of all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity 
And Hamilton who felt it a religious duty to oppose Aaron Burr's political ambitions would have been a better actuarial risk had he shown more literary restraint 
The Seven Founders were completely dedicated to the public service 
Madison once remarked My life has been so much a public one a comment which fits the careers of the other six 
Franklin retired from editing and publishing at the age of 42 and for the next forty-two years devoted himself to public scientific and philanthropic interests 
Washington never had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best plantation management 
He served as Commander in Chief during the Revolution without compensation 
John Adams took to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor Jeremiah Gridley to pursue the study of the law rather than the gain of it 
In taking account of seventeen years of law practice Adams concluded that no lawyer in America ever did so much business as I did and for so little profit 
When the Revolution broke out he along with Jefferson and Jay abandoned his career at the bar with considerable financial sacrifice 
Hamilton poorest of the seven gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet 
While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends 
If you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars he wrote one friend in 1791 when he was Secretary of the Treasury 
To support his large family Hamilton went back to the law after each spell of public service 
Talleyrand passed his New York law office one night on the way to a party 
Hamilton was bent over his desk drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle 
The Frenchman was astonished 
I have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune of his country but now is working all night in order to support his family he reflected 
All seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality 
John Adams asserted in the Continental Congress' Declaration of Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters the British Constitution and the common law and Jefferson appealed in the Declaration of Independence to the tribunal of the world for support of a revolution justified by the laws of nature and of nature's God 
They fought hard but they were forgiving to former foes and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 1783 
This sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified in an exchange of letters between John Jay and a Tory refugee Peter Van Schaack 
Jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend Van Schaack 
Yet when at war's end the ex-Tory made the first move to resume correspondence Jay wrote him from Paris where he was negotiating the peace settlement 
As an independent American I considered all who were not for us and you amongst the rest as against us yet be assured that John Jay never ceased to be the friend of Peter Van Schaack 
The latter in turn assured him that were I arraigned at the bar and you my judge I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause 
All seven recognized that independence was but the first step toward building a nation 
We have now a national character to establish Washington wrote in 1783 
Think continentally Hamilton counseled the young nation 
This new force love of country super-imposed upon if not displacing affectionate ties to one's own state was epitomized by Washington 
His first inaugural address speaks of my country whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love 
All sought the fruition of that nationalism in a Federal Government with substantial powers 
Save Jefferson all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal Constitution 
They supported it not as a perfect instrument but as the best obtainable 
Historians have traditionally regarded the great debates of the Seventeen Nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized vs. limited government with Hamilton and the nationalists supporting the former and Jefferson and Madison upholding the latter position 
The state's rights position was formulated by Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves but in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians 
In purchasing Louisiana Jefferson had to adopt Hamilton's broad construction of the Constitution and so did Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton's bank which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception and in adopting a Hamiltonian protective tariff 
Indeed the old Jeffersonians were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they were to the Jacksonian Democrats 
When in 1832 the South Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve they elicited no encouragement from that senior statesman 
In his political testament Advice To My Country penned just before his death Madison expressed the wish that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated 
Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her box opened 
and the disguised one as the serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into Paradise 
Tobacco Road is dead 
Long live Tobacco Road 
Nostalgic Yankee readers of Erskine Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians that Tobacco Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway over which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop 
Thus we are compelled to face the urbanization of the South an urbanization which despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers 
Indeed it seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint juleps continue to live but only as a weary overexploited phantom 
Those writers known collectively as the Southern school have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize 
according to many critics in fact the South has led the North in literature since the Civil War both quantitatively and qualitatively 
Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance 
It is interesting however that despite this strong upsurge in Southern writing almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season's cotton and tobacco crops 
of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields 
of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps of the past century 
This is not to say that the South is no longer agrarian 
such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification 
But the South is and has been for the past century engaged in a wide-sweeping urbanization which oddly enough is not reflected in its literature 
In 1900 the South was only 15% urban 
in 1950 it had become 47.1% urban 
In a mere half-century the South has more than tripled its urban status 
There is a New South emerging a South losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche especially within recent decades 
As the New South snowballs toward further urbanization it becomes more and more homogeneous with the North a tendency which Willard Thorp terms Yankeefication as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte Birmingham and Houston 
It is said that even at the present stage of Southern urbanization such a city as Atlanta is not distinctly unlike Columbus or Trenton 
Undoubtedly even the old Southern stalwart Richmond has felt the new wind William Styron mentions in his latest novel an avenue named for Bankhead McGruder a Civil War general now renamed in typical California fashion Buena Vista Terrace 
The effects of television and other mass media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force 
As for progress the backward South can boast of Baton Rouge which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent to 126,000 the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25,000 
The field then is ripe for new Southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century phenomenon the Southern Yankeefication the new urban economy the city-dweller the pains of transition the labor problems 
the list is obviously endless 
But these sources have not been tapped 
Truman Capote is still reveling in Southern Gothicism exaggerating the old Southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque but as unreal as or even more unreal than yesterday 
William Styron while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes 
Even the great god Faulkner the South's one probable contender for literary immortality has little concerned himself with these matters 
such are simply not within his bounded province 
Where are the writers to treat these changes 
Has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted 
Perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades 
Lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money 
An example of the changes which have crept over the Southern region may be seen in the Southern Negro's quest for a position in the white-dominated society a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since 1865 
Today the Negro must discover his role in an industrialized South which indicates that the racial aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't changed radically but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context this new coat of paint 
The Negro faces as much if not more difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one 
This represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem 
But there have been abrupt changes as well the sit-ins the picket lines the bus strikes all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago 
Today's evidence such as the fact that only three Southern states South Carolina Alabama and Mississippi still openly defy integration would have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into speechlessness 
Other examples of gradual changes that have affected the Negro have been his moving up row by row in the buses 
his requesting and often getting higher wages better working conditions better schools changes that were slowly emerging even before the Supreme Court decision of 1954 
Then came this decision which sped the process of gaining equality or perhaps hindered it 
only historical evolution will determine which an abrupt change 
Since 1954 the Negro's desire for social justice has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion 
He has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws 
This bold self-assertion after decades of humble subservience is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon an abrupt change in the Southern way of existence 
A new order is thrusting itself into being 
A new South is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation uncertainty and lack of action from the Negro in defining his new role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white man 
The modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into Southern fiction 
It is clear that while most writers enjoy picturing the Negro as a woolly-headed humble old agrarian who mutters yassuhs and sho' nufs with blissful deference to his white employer or in Old South terms massuh this stereotype is doomed to become in reality as obsolete as Caldwell's Lester 
While there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through the rural South such men appear to be a vanishing breed 
Writers openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man 
but they obviously mean by this not a Negro personality but a Negro type 
Presenting an individualized Negro character it would seem is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could tackle 
and the success of such an endeavor is as suggested above glaringly rare 
Just as the Negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes affecting Southern life it also points up the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature 
The book concerned with the Negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed 
recently only Keith Wheeler's novel Peaceable Lane has openly faced the problem 
All but the most rabid of Confederate flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life 
Many earlier writers mourning the demise of the old order tended to romanticize and exaggerate this gracious Old South imagery creating such lasting impressions as Margaret Mitchell's Tara Plantation 
Modern writers who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects insist upon drawing out this legend prolonging its burial when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century 
Perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing 
but they can hardly deny that exaggerated or not the old panorama is dead 
As John T. Westbrook says in his article Twilight Of Southern Regionalism Southwest Review Winter 1957 The miasmal mausoleum where an Old South already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry should be left to rest in peace forever dead and let us fervently hope forever done with 
Westbrook further bemoans the Southern writers' creation of an unreal image of their homeland which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting Yankees Our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence of urbanization presented to his senses 
It bewilders and befuddles him 
He is too deeply steeped in William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren 
The fumes of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes but his heart is away in Yoknapatawpha County with razorback hogs and night riders 
On this trip to the South he wants above all else to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight 
Obviously such a Northern tourist's purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with Disneyland he wants to see a world of make-believe 
In the meantime while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee Southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's progress 
Willard Thorp in his new book American Writing In The Twentieth Century observes quite validly it seems Certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched 
No Southern novelist has done for Atlanta or Birmingham what Herrick Dreiser and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos Passos did for New York 
There are almost no fictional treatments of the industrialized south 
Not a single Southern author major or minor has made the urban problems of an urban South his primary source material 
Faulkner for one appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard 
Faulkner culminates the Southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been or could ever be done 
He has made it his and his it remains irrevocably 
He treats it with a mythological universal application 
As his disciples boast even though his emphasis is elsewhere Faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly as can be proven by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes families 
Even two decades ago in Go Down Moses Faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil 
Yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact 
Faulkner traces in his vast and overpowering saga of Yoknapatawpha County the gradual changes which seep into the South building layer upon layer of minute subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the Old Way 
Thus Faulkner reminds us and wisely that the new South has gradually evolved out of the Old South and consequently its agrarian roots persist 
Yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself the problems with which a New South must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization 
With new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil 
The thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas 
Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre 
Most avant-garde creators true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors often black and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting 
But Robert Rauschenberg the neo-dadaist artist has collaborated with several of them 
He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham's Summerspace so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity 
For Mr. Taylor's Images And Reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer and a girl's cape lined with grass 
Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor 
In fact he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion shape light and sound 
To raise the dancer out of his personal pedestrian self Mr. Nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger environmental orbit 
He began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be 
He went on to use objects hoops poles capes which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer who moved with them 
The depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure 
In each case the object the color even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer 
The dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol begins to feel that it is part of herself 
Or clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of hoops the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a finial 
As the dancer is depersonalized his accouterments are animized and the combined elements give birth to a new being 
From this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit 
Thus the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition 
But since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal 
Some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work 
Others less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet painter and musician 
An approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of Charles Olson's statement of the process of projective verse one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception 
The creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience 
He disdains external restrictions conventional syntax traditional metre 
The unit of form is determined subjectively the Heart by the way of the Breath to the Line 
The test of form is fidelity to the experience a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters 
An earlier but still influential school of painting surrealism had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience that event in which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious 
The resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order 
The contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines colors masses and energies 
He is still concerned however with a personal event 
He accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation 
The work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience 
Some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher more serene level of truth 
Rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world 
The concept remains subjective 
But in this approach it is the artist's ultimate insight rather than his immediate impressions that gives form to the work 
Others look to more objective devices of order 
The musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes a mathematical system of rotations that once set in motion determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities 
The composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals or rhythms or dynamic changes 
He may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers 
But he cannot order his elements by will either rational or inspired 
The system works as an impersonal mechanism 
Musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development 
Again the composer must select his own materials 
But a tossing of coins with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the I Ching the Chinese Book Of Changes dictates the handling of the chosen materials 
Avant-garde choreographers seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements have turned to similar approaches 
Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation 
According to Katherine Litz the becoming the process of realization is the dance 
The process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it 
The sequence may involve a sharp contrast for example a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap 
or it may involve more subtle distinctions the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head 
Even the least alteration will change the quality 
An exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance 
The approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic as it is for Miss Litz or spontaneous as it is for Merle Marsicano 
She too is concerned with the becoming the process of realization but she does not think in terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns 
The design is determined emotionally I must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me 
Looking back Miss Marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock 
At one time she felt impelled to make dances that moved all over the stage much as Pollock's paintings move violently over the full extent of the canvas 
But her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form a need to let the experience shape itself 
Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement 
It may be a free front-back swing of the leg leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground 
This became a dance called Prelude To Flight 
A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus 
Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion 
He seeks to make his dancers more godlike by relating them to the impersonal elements of shape light color and sound 
If his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from Mars this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world a world in which they are freed of their pedestrian identities 
It is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered 
In his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer moves and this self in the first revealed stroke of its existence states the theme from which all else must follow 
The theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve 
It may be a reaction to a percussive sound the following movements constituting further reactions 
It may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color in which case changes in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs 
Unconcerned with the practical function of his actions the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their motional content 
Movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive 
But the metamorphosis must come first 
Though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity Merce Cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim 
He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect 
He bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything 
An order can be chanced rather than chosen and this approach produces an experience that is free and discovered rather than bound and remembered 
Thus there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well 
Chance he finds enables him to create a world beyond imagination 
He cites with pleasure the comment of a lady who exclaimed after a concert Why it's extremely interesting 
But I would never have thought of it myself 
The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life 
At one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly 
nearby another sits motionless while still another is twirling an umbrella 
A man and a girl happen to meet 
they look straight at the audience not at each other 
He lifts her puts her down and walks off neither pleased nor disturbed as if nothing had happened 
If one dancer slaps another the victim may do a pirouette sit down or offer his assailant a fork and spoon 
Events occur without apparent reason 
Their consequences are irrelevant or there are no consequences at all 
The sequence is determined by chance and Mr. Cunningham makes use of any one of several chance devices 
He may toss coins 
he may take slips of paper from a grab bag 
The answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design special slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed 
The other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance 
The only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the movements themselves the number of the dancers and the approximate total duration of the dance 
The approximate is important because even after the order of the work has been established by the chance method the result is not inviolable 
Each performance may be different 
If a work is divided into several large segments a last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for any particular performance 
And any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether 
Mr. Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method 
he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can 
However there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute 
Then the choreographer must arbitrate 
He must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other 
He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap 
The North and the South were in greater agreement on sovereignty through all their dispute about it than were the Founding Fathers 
The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee 
The people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles in understanding of and belief in the federal balance and in love of their Union 
Repeated efforts beginning with the Missouri Compromise of 1821 were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise rather than clear thought and timely action 
Even so confusion in this period gained such strength from compromise and other factors that it led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century 
Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty 
The present issue in Atlantica whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by Civil War 
And so I would only touch upon it now much as I have long wanted to write a book about it 
I think it is essential however to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in 1861 if only to see better how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject 
The difference came down to this The Southern States insisted that the United States was in last analysis what its name implied a Union of States 
To their leaders the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states who therefore retained the right to secede from it 
This right of the State its upholders contended was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the Union government 
The champions of the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed fundamentally the united people of America that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states and that therefore the states had no right to secede though the citizens could 
Writing to Speed on August 24 1855 Lincoln made the latter point clear 
In homely terms whose timeliness is startling today he thus declared his own right to secede 

We began by declaring that all men are created equal 
We now practically read it all men are created equal except Negroes 
When the Know-nothings get control it will read All men are created equal except Negroes and foreigners and Catholics 
When it comes to this I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty to Russia for instance where despotism can be taken pure without the base alloy of hypocrisy His emphasis 

When the Southern States exercised their right to secede they formed what they officially styled The Confederate States of America 
Dictionaries as we have seen still cite this government along with the Articles of Confederation of 1781 as an example of a confederacy 
The fact is that the Southern Confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as the Federal Constitution did 
The Confederate Constitution copied much of the Federal Constitution verbatim and most of the rest in substance 
It operated on by and for the people individually just as did the Federal Constitution 
It made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments and among the executive legislative and judicial branches 
The difference between confederacy and federal union in 1861 
Many believe and understandably that the great difference between the Constitution of the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede 
But though each of its members had asserted this right against the Union the final Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11 nearly a month before hostilities began included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede 
Its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their Constitution 
Their President Jefferson Davis interpreted their Constitution to mean that it admits of no coerced association but this remained so doubtful that there were frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution 
The Constitution of the Southern Confederation differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects It openly defiantly recognized slavery an institution which the Southerners of 1787 even though they continued it found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the Federal Constitution 
They recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest and that to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the Declaration of 1776 that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among them are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
The other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the President of the Confederacy held office for six instead of four years and was limited to one term 
These are not however differences in federal structure 
The only important differences from that standpoint between the two Constitutions lies in their Preambles 
The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 expressed as clearly as language can the opposite concept that they were acting directly as citizens 
Here are the two Preambles Federal Constitution 1789 
we the People of the United States in order to form a more perfect Union establish Justice insure domestic Tranquility provide for the common Defence promote the general Welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America 
Confederate Constitution 1861 
We the people of the Confederate States each state acting in its sovereign and independent character in order to form a permanent federal government establish justice insure domestic tranquility and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity invoking the favor and the guidance of Almighty God do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America 
One is tempted to say that on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles the worst war of the Nineteenth century was fought 
But though the Southern States when drafting a constitution to unite themselves narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede the fact remained that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states 
If the Union conceded this to them the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede This would destroy the federal balance between it and the states and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their Union 
Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the issue for the Union a vital one Whether it was a Union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live or an association of sovereign states that must fall prey either to anarchy or despotism 
Much as he abhorred slavery Lincoln was always willing to concede to each slave state the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it 
Though his election was interpreted by many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the Union Lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the Constitution gave the states 
After the war began he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action even in the Border States that stayed with the Union 
He issued his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the Union 
In his Message of December 2 1862 he put his purpose and his policy in these words which I would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union In giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free 
What Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the Union 
He fought to the end to preserve it as a government of the people by the people for the people 
The truth on each side won in the civil war 
The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more securely in slavery the antithesis of individual liberty made the conflict grimmer and the greater 
Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged in the South as in the North as America's true sovereign in a new birth of freedom as Lincoln promised 
But before this came about 214,938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states 
On their decisive battlefield Lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the brave men living and dead who fought here 
He understood that both sides were at fault and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his Second Inaugural 
To my knowledge Lincoln remains the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt proved man enough to say this publicly to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error and in all our error some truth 
So great a man could not but understand too that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought which their opponents see and attack but the truth which the latter do not see any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend 
It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln's day to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the States and to their Union 
They differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth That individual life liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two and on the limitation of sovereignty in all its aspects which this involves 
The 140,414 Americans who gave the last full measure of devotion to prevent disunion preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers of anarchy inherent in confederations which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states and to the liberties of their people 
But the fact that 70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways 
Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter ended by costing the Southerners their right to have slaves a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man 
The very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method war led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for since it forced Lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure 
There was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another 
There was also a lesson one that has served ever since to keep Americans in their conflicts with one another from turning from the ballot to the bullet 
Yet though the Southern States lost the worst errors in their case they did not lose the truth they fought for 
The lives so many of them gave to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment by the Union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to safeguard all Americans against freedom's other foe 
As cells coalesced into organisms they built new unnatural and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world 
The useful suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments 
One wonders about its applicability to people 
Will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction 
The answer is of course yes 
For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit composed of people which gives us both some immunity from and a way of dealing with other people 
Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes 
But it has been during the last two centuries during the scientific revolution that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides 
We have ample light when the sun sets 
the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons 
we fly through the air although gravity pulls us down 
the range of our voice ignores distance 
At what stage are social sciences then 
Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton 
There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud 
And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact 
Political theoretical understanding although almost at a standstill during this century did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man 
Consitutional government popular vote trial by jury public education labor unions cooperatives communes socialized ownership world courts and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples 
Most of these with horrible exceptions were conceived as is a ship not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind nor to deny its force but as a means to survive and enjoy it 
The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme 
Just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding 
We are desperately in the need of such invention for man is still very much at the mercy of man 
In fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other 
3 
I want therefore to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science the connection between scientific understanding and fear 
There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears 
Lucretius has remarked The reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause and these they attribute to the will of God 
Perhaps things were even worse then 
It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man 
We get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was 
We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets 
The bombs are as harmless as an automobile in a garage 
We are worried about what people may do with them that some crazy fool may push the button 
I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly 
They are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual 
They include both individual fears and collective ones 
They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group 
Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective and the whole pattern becomes ritualized 
Yet often fear persists because even with the most rigid ritual one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act 
To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition 
But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating 
The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize 
It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice 
This and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually first with the Ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then more firmly with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions 
This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls 
In fact although we have dispelled the fear we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers 
There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision 
A meteor could fall on San Francisco 
Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought 
Our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which in this case amounts to doing nothing 
Yet we no longer feel uneasy 
This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war 
We in our country think of war as an external threat which if it occurs will not be primarily of our own doing 
And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave 
What elements of our behavior are decisive 
Our weapons production our world prestige our ideas of democracy our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage 
We have staved off a war and since our behavior has involved all these elements we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective 
I think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city 
If an automobile were approaching him he would know what was required of him even though he might not be able to act quickly enough 
With the group of boys it is different 
He does not know whether to look up or look aside to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side to cross the street or to continue on the same side 
When confronted with a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others 
I believe that what I do has some effect on his actions and I have learned in a way to commune with drunks but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics 
I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose 
Our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise 
We are forced in our behavior towards others to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements 
Our collective policies group and national are similarly based on voodoo but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged in determing them 
We use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as trust cheat and get tough 
We talk about national character in the same way that Copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles 
We perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect 
Small wonder then that we fear 
The achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago 
What additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played 
In the physical sciences these achievements concern electricity chemistry and atomic physics 
In the life sciences there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease in the mechanisms of heredity and in bio- and physiological chemistry 
The major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment 
In addition our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed 
Even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking but where some explanations are possible as with lightning and weather and earthquakes the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated 
Apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears 
How and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study 
In some areas the progress is slower than in others 
In agriculture for example despite the advances in biology elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster 
In child care the opposite extreme prevails 
procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory 
There are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear 
Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared 
The persistent horror of having a malformed child has I believe been reduced not because we have gained any control over this misfortune but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it 
In fact the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding and thus in this instance science has momentarily aggravated our fears 
In fact insofar as science generates any fear it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise which until they are understood create uncertainty 
Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease 
The situation with regard to our attitude and control of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect to people 
The fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear I have tried to describe 
Nothing like Godot he arrived before the hour 
His letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve 
He was waiting 
My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work 
American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic 
They find deep pessimism in them 
Even so astute a commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said that Waiting For Godot is the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair 
But to me Beckett's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism 
Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me 
Is his a literature of defeat irrelevant to the social crises we face 
Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves 
I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions because a man is not the same as his writing in the last analysis the questions had to be settled by the work itself 
Nevertheless I was curious 
My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature a Jesuit father at a conference on religious drama near Paris 
When Beckett's name came into the discussion the priest grew loud and told me that Beckett hates life 
That I thought is at least one thing I can find out when we meet 
Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish 
The features of his face are distinct but not fine 
They look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel 
Unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead standing so high that the top falls gently over as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle 
One might say it combines the man 
own pride and humility 
For he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility perhaps of the same genesis not to impose himself upon another 
His light blue eyes set deep within the face are actively and continually looking 
He seems by some unconscious division of labor to have given them that one function and no other leaving communication to the rest of the face 
The mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile 
The voice is light in timbre with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage 
The Irish accent is as one would expect combined with slight inflections from the French 
His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green 
He wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie 
We walked down the Rue De L'Arcade thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church 
The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering 
For one thing the world that Beckett sees is already shattered 
His talk turns to what he calls the mess or sometimes this buzzing confusion 
I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation 
What appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words 
The confusion is not my invention 
We cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion 
It is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in 
The only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess 
It is not a mess you can make sense of 
I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth but Beckett did not take to the word truth 
What is more true than anything else 
To swim is true and to sink is true 
One is not more true than the other 
One cannot speak anymore of being one must speak only of the mess 
When Heidegger and Sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence they may be right I don't know but their language is too philosophical for me 
I am not a philosopher 
One can only speak of what is in front of him and that now is simply the mess 
Then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form 
Until recently art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things 
It has held them at bay 
It realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form 
How could the mess be admitted because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be 
But now we can keep it out no longer because we have come into a time when it invades our experience at every moment 
It is there and it must be allowed in 
I granted this might be so but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously 
And why not 
How I asked could chaos be admitted to chaos 
Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art 
If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form 
Beckett's own work is an example 
Plays more highly formalized than Waiting For Godot Endgame and Krapp's Last Tape would be hard to find 
What I am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art 
It only means that there will be new form and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else 
The form and the chaos remain separate 
The latter is not reduced to the former 
That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates 
To find a form that accommodates the mess that is the task of the artist now 
Yet I responded could not similar things be said about the art of the past 
Is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable way 
What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory 
Isn't all art ambiguous 
Not this he said and gestured toward the Madeleine 
The classical lines of the church which Napoleon thought of as a Temple of Glory dominated all the scene where we sat 
The Boulevard De La Madeleine the Boulevard Malesherbes and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful flattery bearing tidings of the Age of Reason 
Not this 
This is clear 
This does not allow the mystery to invade us 
With classical art all is settled 
But it is different at Chartres 
There is the unexplainable and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer 
I asked about the battle between life and death in his plays 
Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide 
Hamm's world is death and Clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside 
Is this life-death question a part of the chaos 
Yes 
If life and death did not both present themselves to us there would be no inscrutability 
If there were only darkness all would be clear 
It is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable 
Take Augustine's doctrine of grace given and grace withheld have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology 
Two thieves are crucified with Christ one saved and the other damned 
How can we make sense of this division 
In classical drama such problems do not arise 
The destiny of Racine's Phedre is sealed from the beginning she will proceed into the dark 
As she goes she herself will be illuminated 
At the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark 
That is the play 
Within this notion clarity is possible but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist there is not such clarity 
The question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary total salvation 
But where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable 
The key word in my plays is perhaps 
Given a theological lead I asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays 
Well really there is none at all 
I have no religious feeling 
Once I had a religious emotion 
It was at my first Communion 
No more 
My mother was deeply religious 
So was my brother 
He knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel 
My father had none 
The family was Protestant but for me it was only irksome and I let it go 
My brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died 
At the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie 
Irish Catholicism is not attractive but it is deeper 
When you pass a church on an Irish bus all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross 
One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs 
But do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with 
Yes for they deal with distress 
Some people object to this in my writing 
At a party an English intellectual so-called asked me why I write always about distress 
As if it were perverse to do so 
He wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood 
I told him no that I had had a very happy childhood 
Then he thought me more perverse than ever 
I left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi 
On the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs one asked for help for the blind another help for orphans and the third for relief for the war refugees 
One does not have to look for distress 
It is screaming at you even in the taxis of London 
Lunch was over and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming at us 
The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar to qualities I had found in the plays 
He says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern 
Perhaps stands in place of commitment 
At the same time he is plainly sympathetic clearly friendly 
If there were only the mess all would be clear 
but there is also compassion 
As a Christian I know I do not stand where Beckett stands but I do see much of what he sees 
As a writer on the theater I have paid close attention to the plays 
Harold Clurman is right to say that Waiting For Godot is a reflection he calls it a distorted reflection of the impasse and disarray of Europe's present politics ethic and common way of life 
Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to 
Waiting For Godot sells even better in America than in France 
The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America but it is the consciousness that most mature societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture 
America is now joining Europe in this mature phase of development 
Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of Asia and Africa and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold 
Even Hemingway for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms never maintained that sex was all 
Hemingway's fiction is supported by a moral backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension 
And D. H. Lawrence in Fantasia Of The Unconscious protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive 
Though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect of human nature it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex 
All is not sex declared Lawrence 
Man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy 
The creative urge for example transcends the body and the self 
But for the beat generation all is sex 
Nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex 
For the beatnik like the hipster is in opposition to a society that is based on the repression of the sex instinct 
He has elevated sex not Eros or libido but pure spontaneous uninhibited sex to the rank of the godhead 
it is Astarte Ishtar Venus Yahwe Dionysus Christ the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the body of the universe 
Jazz is sex marijuana is a stimulus to sex the beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse 
Lawrence Lipton in The Holy Barbarians stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure 
it is a mystique and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe of discourse 
The singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place 
The dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual desire 
For this reason too their language is more forthright and earthy 
The beatniks crave a sexual experience in which their whole being participates 
It is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy 
They withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety 
Unlike the heroes and flappers of the lost generation they disdain the art of necking and petting 
That is reserved for the squares 
If they avoid the use of the pungent outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo 
it is sacred 
As Lipton the prophet of the beat generation declares In the sexual act the beat are filled with mana the divine power 
This is far from the vulgar leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat 
This is the Holy Grail these knights of the orgasm pursue this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they respond 
If Wilhelm Reich is the Moses who has led them out of the Egypt of sexual slavery Dylan Thomas is the poet who offers them the Dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence in liquor marijuana sex and jazz 
In addition they have been converted to Zen Buddhism with its glorification of all that is natural and mysteriously alive the sense that everything in the world is flowing 
Thus paradoxically the beat writers resort to religious metaphors they are in search of mana the spiritual the numinous but not anything connected with formal religion 
What they are after is the beatific vision 
And Zen Buddhism though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release 
The style of life chosen by the beat generation the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience 
Jazz is good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect 
Jazz is the musical language of sex the vocabulary of the orgasm 
indeed it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz by freeing the listener of his inhibitions can have therapeutic value 
That is why the argument runs the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it 
Instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction 
Thus jazz is transmuted into something holy the sacred road to integration of being 
Jazz like sex is a mystique 
It is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man 
The mystique of sex combined with marijuana and jazz is intended to provide a design for living 
Those who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free their instincts put at the service of the imagination 
Righteous in their denunciation of all that makes for death the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats 
let them learn to swing freely to let go to become authentically themselves and then perhaps civilization will be saved 
The beatnik seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present 
If he is the child of nothingness if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil 
He will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth 
That is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians 
they will destroy the shrines temples museums and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe in 
Apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge 
Their writing born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality reflects the extremity of their existential alienation 
The mind has betrayed them reason is the foe of life 
they will trust only their physical sensations the wisdom of the body the holy promptings of the unconscious 
With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate but their faith in love inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz culminates in the climax of the orgasm 
Their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath rootless and irresponsible 
Their rebellion against authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile delinquent 
And the life they lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive even though they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit writing painting music 
They are non-conformists on principle 
When they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth the rage of repudiation the ecstasy of negation 
It is sex that obsesses them sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed 
What they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the Muse 
Monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability 
One girl describes her past her succession of broken marriages the abortions she has had and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion 
If it is an honest feeling then why should she not yield to it 
Most often she says it's the monogamous relationship that is dishonest 
There is nothing holy in wedlock 
This girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapproves of her life 
She finds married life stifling and every prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous 
This confession serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution the craving for sensation for its own sake the need for change for new experiences 
Boredom is death 
In the realm of physical sensations sex reigns supreme 
Hence the beatniks sustain themselves on marijuana jazz free swinging poetry exhausting themselves in orgies of sex 
some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality 
One beat poet composes a poem Lines On A Tijuana John which contains a few happy hints for survival 
The new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity 
The professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction but what they produce is unfortunately disordered nourished solely on the hysteria of negation 
Who are the creative representatives of this movement 
Nymphomaniacs junkies homosexuals drug addicts lesbians alcoholics the weak the frustrated the irresolute the despairing the derelicts and outcasts of society 
They embrace independent poverty usually with a shack-up partner who will help support them 
They are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony 
Their previous legalized marriages do not count for they hold the laws of the state null and void 
They feel they are leagued against a hostile persecutory world faced with the concerted malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings the police 
This is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending their way of life their search for wholeness though their actual existence fails to reach these religious heights 
One beatnik got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up 
What obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk 
Sex as the creative principle of the universe the secret of primitive religion the life of myth 
Everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual symbolism 
In his chapter on The Loveways Of The Beat Generation Lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details 
No one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in West Venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the group 
The women who come to West Venice having forsaken radicalism are interested in living only for the moment in being constantly on the move 
Others who are attracted to this Mecca of the beat generation are homosexuals heroin addicts and smalltime hoodlums 
Those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks 
Since the homosexuals widely use marijuana they do not have to be initiated 
Part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana 
As Lipton puts it The Eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force as a unifying principle in human relationships than at any other time except perhaps in the mutual metaphysical orgasms 
The magic circle is in fact a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm 
Under the influence of marijuana the beatnik comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being 
Carried high on this charge he composes magical poetry that captures the organic rhythms of life in words 
If he thus achieves a lyrical dreamlike drugged intensity he pays the price for his indulgence by producing work Allen Ginsberg's Howl is a striking example of this tendency that is disoriented Dionysian but without depth and without Apollonian control 
For drugs are in themselves no royal road to creativity 
How is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic derangement of senses 
If love reflects the nature of man as Ortega Y Gasset believes if the person in love betrays decisively what he is by his behavior in love then the writers of the beat generation are creating a new literary genre 
There were fences in the old days when we were children 
Across the front of a yard and down the side they were iron either spiked along the top or arched in half circles 
Alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one's head but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them 
Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses 
front fences were covered with Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle 
Square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage 
they were topped by steeples complete in every detail high-pitched roof pinnacle and narrow gable 
On these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang 
The only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree 
The primary quality of that view seems now to have been its quietness but that cannot at the time have impressed us 
What one actually remembers is its greenness 
From high in the tree the whole block lay within range of the eye but the ground was almost nowhere visible 
One looked down on a sea of leaves a breaking wave of flower 
Every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor and every yard had its fruit trees 
In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet-shrub snowball rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead 
From above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea a neighbor's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there half-way down the block 
That was one epoch the apple-tree epoch 
Another had ended before it began 
Time is a queer thing and memory a queerer 
the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all 
From maturity one looks back at the succession of years counts them and makes them many yet cannot feel length in the number however large 
In a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water 
the mill-pond is quiet its surface dark and shadowed and there does not seem to be much water in it 
Time in the sum is nothing 
And yet a year to a child is an eternity and in the memory that phase of one's being a certain mental landscape will seem to have endured without beginning and without end 
The part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate It could have been like that for only a little while 
but true memory does not count nor add it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time 
Once then for how many years or how few does not matter my world was bound round by fences when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough to twist my knee over it and pull myself up 
That world was in scale with my own smallness 
I have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole that I could not see but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory wind-blown frost-bitten white chrysanthemums beneath a window with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November 
ripe pears lying in long grass to be turned over by a dusty-slippered foot cautiously lest bees still worked in the ragged brown-edged holes 
hot-colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch where we passed on our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it 
It was mother who planted the verbenas 
I think that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren 
My great-grandmother I have been told made her garden her great pride 
she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar 
she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house 
These my grandmother left in their places they are still there more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man and planted others like them that flourished without careful tending 
Three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment the roses whose petals might not be collected until they had fallen to be made into perfume or rose-tea to drink 
the peonies whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying on of a finger although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them 
and the poppies 
I have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap unfolded and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals 
Other flowers we might gather as we pleased myrtle and white violets from beneath the lilacs 
the lilacs themselves that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach 
snowballs 
hollyhock blossoms that turned upside down make pink-petticoated ladies 
and the little dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere 
More potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind intrinsic because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them 
Flowers stones and small creatures living and dead 
Pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite 
seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch 
red-and-yellow columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and eaten for the honey in them 
morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag 
bright flowers from the trumpet vine that made gloves on the ends of ten waggling fingers 
Fuzzy caterpillars snails with their sensitive horns struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded to spit tobacco spit 
Dead fledgling birds their squashed-looking nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags 
And the cast shell of a locust straw-colored and transparent weighing nothing fragile but entire with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down its back 
Every morning early in the summer we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells carefully detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung and stabled them a weird faery herd in an angle between the high roots of the tulip tree where no grass grew in the dense shade 
We collected lucky stones all the creamy translucent pebbles worn smooth and round that we could find in the driveway 
When these had been pocketed we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors indicated 
We showed them to each other and said Would you have guessed 
Squatting on our haunches beside the flat stone we broke them on we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passers-by 
Thus shielded we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness 
even when the fences became a part of the game when a vine-embowered gate-post was the Sleeping Beauty's enchanted castle or when Rapunzel let down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire even then we paid little heed to those who went by on the path outside 
We enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school 
In the heat of the summer the garden solitudes were ours alone 
our elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch 
They never troubled themselves about us while we were playing because the fence formed such a definite boundary and Don't go outside the gate was a command so impossible of misinterpretation 
We were not however entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street 
We were forbidden to swing on the gates lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way but we could stand on them when they were latched rest our chins on the top and stare and stare committing to memory quite unintentionally all the details that lay before our eyes 
The street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees and silence was a weight almost palpable in the air 
Every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again crushed beneath it 
A hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves 
A wheel squeaked on a hub was still and squeaked again 
If a child watched its progress he whispered Hay hay load of hay make a wish and turn away and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses' feet returned no more 
When the hay wagon had gone and an interval passed a huckster's cart might turn the corner 
The horse walked the reins were slack the huckster rode with bowed shoulders his forearms across his knees 
Sleepily as if half-reluctant to break the silence he lifted his voice Rhu-beb-ni-ice nice fresh rhu-beb today 
The lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee 
No one seemed to hear him no one heeded 
The horse plodded on and he repeated his call 
It became so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness 
After his passage the street was empty again 
The sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down 
the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk from sidewalk to lawn 
At four-o'clock or four-thirty the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day 
he tossed a paper toward every front door and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing 
The streets of any county town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer 
they were like this fifty-odd years ago and yesterday 
But the fences were still in place fifty-odd years ago and when we stood on the gate to look over the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides 
The curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees 
Opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage-step set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse 
The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center 
it was mud in wet weather and dust ankle-deep in dry and could be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones 
It had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since 
The hoofmarks of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod horses 
Cows were kept in backyard barns boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town and familiar to the ear morning and evening were the boys' coaxing voices the thud of hooves and the thwack of a stick on cowhide 
It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for Mann's work 
The wife Amra and her lover are both savagely portrayed she as incarnate sensuality voluptuous and indolent possibly a mischief maker with a kind of luxurious cunning to set against her apparent simplicity her birdlike brain 
Lautner for his part belonged to the present-day race of small artists who do not demand the utmost of themselves and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as wretched little poseurs the devastating indictment they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order and the somewhat extreme prophecy so far not fulfilled They will be destroyed 
The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well 
His appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience 
it is a spectacle absolutely painful an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation 
At the same time the multiple transvestitism involved the fat man as girl and as baby as coquette pretending to be a baby touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby's upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life 
The music which Lautner has composed for this episode is for the most part rather pretty and perfectly banal 
But it is characteristic of him we are told his little artifice to be able to introduce into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art 
And this occurs now at the refrain of Jacoby's song at the point in fact of the name Lizzy 
a modulation described as almost a stroke of genius 
A miracle a revelation it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude 
It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and simultaneously his wife's infidelity 
By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience 
he collapses and dies 
In the work of every artist I suppose there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive ultimately emblematic of what it is all about 
not less strikingly so for being mysterious as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image a single moment 
So here 
The horrifying humor the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby 
the epiphany of that quivering flesh 
the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent mindless sensuality and sharp shrewd talent cleverness with an occasional touch of genius which however does not know how to attack the problem of suffering 
the miraculous way in which music revelation and death are associated in a single instant all this seems a triumph of art a rather desperate art in itself 
beyond itself also it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's work 
When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance I come up with the following ideas which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay 
Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann's heroes 
The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love 
The release the freedom involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible 
and the motion toward it brings disaster 
This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art 
it is particularly the artist Tonio Kroger Aschenbach Leverkuhn who suffers from it 
The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the breakthrough in the realm of art 
Again the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood with the figure of a child 
Finally the theatrical and perversely erotic notions of dressing up cosmetics disguise and especially change of costume or singularity of costume as with Cipolla are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann's stories 
We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates 
For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby at the moment of his collapse all these elements come together in prophetic parody 
Professionally a lawyer that is to say associated with dignity reserve discipline with much that is essentially middle-class he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up disguised that is paradoxically revealed as a child and worse as a whore masquerading as a child 
That this abandonment takes place on a stage during an artistic performance is enough to associate Jacoby with art and to bring down upon him the punishment for art 
that is he is suspect guilty punishable as is anyone in Mann's stories who produces illusion and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature technique magic guilt and suffering are divided in this story between Jacoby and Lautner 
It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann's early tales however pictorial or even picturesque the surface is already toward the symbolic the emblematic the expressionistic 
In a certain perfectly definite way the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same 
Something of this can be learned from The Way To The Churchyard 1901 an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure 
There is no more plot than that 
only slightly more perhaps than a newspaper account of such an incident would give 
The artistic interest then lies in what the encounter may be made to represent in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness 
The first sentence with its platitudinous irony announces an emblematic intent The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad ran beside it all the way to the end 
that is to say to the churchyard 
And the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction 
The highroad one might say at first belongs to life while the way to the churchyard belongs to death 
But that is too simple and won't hold up 
As the first sentence suggests both roads belong to death in the end 
But the highroad according to the description of its traffic belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life a suffering form an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death 
Thus on the highroad a troop of soldiers marched in their own dust and sang while on the footpath one man walks alone 
This man's isolation is not merely momentary it is permanent 
He is a widower his three children are dead he has no one left on earth 
also he is a drunk and has lost his job on that account 
His name is Praisegod Piepsam and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister type in the author's repertory he is a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in Death In Venice for example who represent some combination of cadaver exotic and psychopomp 
This strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad 
The cyclist a sufficiently commonplace young fellow is not named but identified simply as Life that and a license number which Piepsam uses in addressing him 
Life points out that everybody uses this path and starts to ride on 
Piepsam tries to stop him by force receives a push in the chest from Life and is left standing in impotent and growing rage while a crowd begins to gather 
His rage assumes a religious form 
that is on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life not only the cyclist now but the audience the world as well all you light-headed breed 
This passion brings on a fit which proves fatal 
Then an ambulance comes along and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away 
This is simple enough but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant 
The season between spring and summer belongs to life in its carefree aspect 
Piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because he cannot stop the cyclist but also because God will not stop him 
as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments His justice is not of this world 
Life is further characterized in antithesis to Piepsam as animal the image of a dog which appears at several places is first given as the criterion of amiable irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle a dog in a wagon is admirable a pleasure to contemplate 
another wagon has no dog and therefore is devoid of interest 
Piepsam calls the cyclist cur and puppy among other things and at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into his face 
The ambulance is drawn by two charming little horses 
Piepsam is not certainly religious in any conventional sense 
His religiousness is intimately or dialectically connected with his sinfulness 
the two may in fact be identical 
His unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings 
he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home and before this wardrobe Praisegod Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue and still in the end capitulated 
The cyclist by contrast blond and blue-eyed is simply unreflective unproblematic Life blithe and carefree 
He made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth 
Piepsam is grotesque a disturbing parody 
his end is ridiculous and trivial 
He is a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard 
But he is more interesting than the others the ones who come from the highroad to watch him more interesting than Life considered as a cyclist 
And if I have gone into so much detail about so small a work that is because it is also so typical a work representing the germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Mann's writing the crude sketch of Piepsam contains in its critical destructive and self-destructive tendencies much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of for instance Naphta and Leverkuhn 
In method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for realism anticipates a kind of musical composition as well as a kind of fictional composition in which as Leverkuhn says there shall be nothing unthematic 
It resembles too pictures such as Durer and Bruegel did in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary the representation of a proverb for example or a deadly sin 
Gladius Dei 1902 resembles The Way To The Churchyard in its representation of a conflict between light and dark between Life and a spirit of criticism negation melancholy but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict 
The monk Savonarola brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn of the century protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art-shop of M. Bluthenzweig 
in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled according to gossip upon the painter's mistress 
Hieronymus like Piepsam makes his protest quite in vain and his rejection though not fatal is ridiculous and humiliating 
he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter 
On the street outside Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence and prophetically he issues his curse Gladius Dei super terram cito et velociter 
The reality to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world 
Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason 
These polar concerns imitation vs. formalism reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period of time 
The breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes 
Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi-mechanistic powers 
The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery 
The image of God has simply disappeared 
All such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism if man can neither know nor love reality as it is he can at least invent an artistic reality which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved 
The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems 
Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive that they belong together 
Without the decay of a sense of objective reference except as the imitation of mystery the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being 
And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written 
For better or worse we cannot regard imitation in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism 
A broader concept of imitation is needed one which acknowledges that true invention is important that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises 
On the other hand we cannot regard artistic invention as pure uncaused and unrelated to the times in which it occurs 
We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism 
Accordingly it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation which I shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation and a new theory of invention which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter 
The mimetic imagination in the arts 
The word mimesis imitation is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle 
For Plato imitation is twice removed from reality being a poor copy of physical appearance which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence 
All artistic and mythological representations therefore are imitations of imitations and are completely superseded by the truth value of dialectic the proper use of the inquiring intellect 
In Plato's judgment the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young prior to the full development of their intellectual powers 
Presupposed in Plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom 
Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and like Plato he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level 
The Poetics in affirming that all human arts are modes of imitation gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato 
But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths 
For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis in contrast to the power of dialectic is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality 
The central concern of Erich Auerbach's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation based upon a recognition of levels of truth to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved 
Following the theme of Incarnation in the Gospels the Christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events figures of divine power and reality 
Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent 
Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons however humble in a divine drama 
The artist unlike the philosopher is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction 
He is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped 
I have chosen to use the word mimesis in its Christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which as in the Christian mind are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience which are not reserved as in the Greek mind only to moments of theoretical reflection 
In the first instance mimesis is here used to mean the recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional designations 
By image is meant not only a visual presentation but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith 
This is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated 
Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself 
The images themselves like their counterparts in experience are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately 
they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another 
They bring an inextricable component of value within themselves with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality 
As in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images 
Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense 
A word taken in its dictionary meaning a photographic image of a recognizable object the mere picturing of a scene tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings 
Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field 
A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy 
The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials 
When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves compelling the observer into an attitude of attention all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance 
These are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice 
The presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely understood 
Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed 
Experience is not seen as it is in classical rationalism as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character movements and changes on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect 
Neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs 
Primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects houses trees implements etc. nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory qualities 
In contrast to all this primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers 
The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings both positive and negative a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself 
a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part 
These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved some working for one's good others threatening ill 
Gone is the tabula rasa of the mind 
In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught 
The principal defender of this view of primary experience as causal efficacy is Alfred North Whitehead 
Our most elemental and unavoidable impressions he says are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future 
We feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening 
Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience 
It takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection 
Whitehead is here questioning David Hume's understanding of the nature of experience 
he is questioning also every epistemology which stems from Hume's presupposition that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world not directly perceived 
What Hume calls sensation is what Whitehead calls perception in the mode of presentational immediacy which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy 
As long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity becomes an invention of consciousness and the result is a philosophical scepticism 
Whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail is initially given in the way man feels the world 
In this respect experience is broader and full of a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct 
A chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past 
Both I and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am 
After only eighteen years of non-interference there were already indications of melioration though in a slight degree to be sure 
There were more indications by the mid-twentieth century 
I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were but I noticed several a few years ago during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg 
In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school and the White school and in every instance the former made a better appearance it was newer for one thing 
It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker T. Washington had been going on 
But with the renewal of interference in 1954 as with its beginning in 1835 the improvement was impaired 
For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them 
It's infuriating this feeling that one is being picked on continually constantly 
By what right of superior virtue Southerners ask do the people of the North do this 
The traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue to show the world that as James's Christopher Newman said to his adversaries however bad I may be you're not quite the people to say it 
In the pre-Civil War years the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North 
At the present time the counter-attack takes the line that there's no more of the true spirit of integration in the North than in the South 
The line is a pretty good one 
People talk about the law of the land 
The expression has become quite a cliche 
But people can't be made to integrate socialize the two are inseparable by Southern standards by law 
I was having lunch not long ago apologies to N. V. Peale with three distinguished historians one specializing in the European Middle Ages one in American history and one in the Far East and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with deliberate speed majestic instancy Francis Thompson's words for the Hound Of Heaven's Pursuit by judicial fiat 
They didn't seem to be able to think of any 
A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change 
But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he said They make a desert and call it peace Solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant 

Moreover the law of the land is not irrevocable 
it can be changed 
it has been many times 
Mr. Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the North and soon became a dead letter 
Prohibition was the law of the land but it was unpopular how many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition days drinking was so gay so fashionable especially in the sophisticated Northeast 
and was repealed 
The cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history 
The Declaration of Independence says that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed 
The phrase consent of the governed needs a hard look 
How do we define it 
Is the consent of the governed a numerical majority 
Calhoun dealt with this question in his Disquisition On Government 
To guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority Calhoun developed his theory of concurrent majority which he said by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government a negative on the others prevents all partial or local legislation 
Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community 
That regional peculiarities do not still exist 
That the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region 
Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of the consent of the governed 
Circumstances alter cases 
A friend of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular trouble out there that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell 
He seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere 
I murmured something about a possible difference between New Mexico's history and Mississippi's 
One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere the THIDIU viewpoint It Doesn't Affect Us 
Southern Liberals there are a good many especially if they're rich often exhibit blithe insouciance 
The trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything 
You've already sent your daughter to Miss X's select academy for girls and your son to Mr. Y's select academy for boys and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity 
If there's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood there's always New England 
New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces South as well as West 
They may even enroll a colored student or two for show though he usually turns out to be from Thailand or any place other than the American South 
It would be interesting to know how much integration there is in the famous fashionable colleges and prep schools of New England 
A recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one thousand at Yale 
that is about one-half of one per cent which looks pretty tokenish to me especially in an institution which professes to be national 
I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is personally affected who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith 
I leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children the question of what their best interests really are 
I'm talking about the grand manner of the Liberal North and South who is not affected personally 
If these people were denied a voice do they have a moral right to a voice 
what voices would be left 
Who is involved willy nilly 
Well after everybody has followed the New England pattern of segregating one's children into private schools only the poor folks are left 
And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds and has always found the most racial friction 
A dear respected friend of mine who like myself grew up in the South and has spent many years in New England said to me not long ago I can't forgive New England for rejecting all complicity 
Being a teacher of American literature I remembered Whittier's Massachusetts To Virginia where he said But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown 
There is a legend Hawthorne records it in his English Notebooks 
And one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves 
Whether historically a fact or not the legend has a certain symbolic value 
Complicity is an embarrassing word 
It is something which most of us try to get out from under 
Like the cowboy in Stephen Crane's Blue Hotel we run around crying Well I didn't do anything did I 
Robert Penn Warren puts it this way in Brother To Dragons The recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence where innocence I think means about the same thing as redemption 
A man must be able to say Father I have sinned or there is no hope for him 
Lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his Second Inaugural that God gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came 
He also spoke of the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited toil 
Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade 
After how many generations is such wealth mounting all the while through the manipulations of high finance purified of taint 
It is a question which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds 
But didn't they get off too easy 
The slaves never shared in their profits while they did share in a very real sense in the profits of the slave-owners they were fed clothed doctored and so forth 
they were the beneficiaries of responsible paternalistic care 
Emerson Platonist idealist doctrinaire sounded a high Transcendental note in his Boston Hymn delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music Hall amidst thundering applause Pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim 
Who is the owner 
The slave is owner And ever was 
Pay him 
It is the abstractionism the unrealism of the pure idealist 
It ignores the sordid financial aspects quite conveniently too for his audience who could indulge in moral indignation without visible or even conscious discomfort their money from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage 
Like Pilate they had washed their hands 
But can one really 
Can God be mocked ever in the long run 
New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence as Jefferson explained in his Autobiography 
The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves and who on the contrary still wished to continue it 
Our Northern brethren also I believe felt a little tender under those censures 
for though their people had very few slaves themselves yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others 
But that was a long time ago 
The New England conscience became desensitized 
George W. Cable naturalized New Englander writing in 1889 from Paradise Road Northampton lovely symbolic name agitated continuously the Southern question 
It was nice to be able to isolate it 
New England as everyone knows has long been schoolmaster to the Nation 
There one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities colleges and preparatory schools of the United States 
Why should this be so 
It is true that New England more than any other section was dedicated to education from the start 
But I think that something more than this is involved 
How did it happen for example that the state university that great symbol of American democracy failed to flourish in New England as it did in other parts of the country 
Isn't it a bit odd that the three states of Southern New England Massachusetts Connecticut and Rhode Island have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past these institutions having previously been A M colleges 
Was it supposed perchance that A M vocational training that is was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in the post-Civil War period the immigrants having been brought in from Southern Europe to work in the mills to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West 
Is it not ironical that Roger Williams's state Rhode Island should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university 
The state universities of Maine New Hampshire And Vermont are older and more respectable 
they had less immigration to contend with 
A Yale historian writing a few years ago in The Yale Review said We in New England have long since segregated our children 
He was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools 
And what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land 
I don't propose to go into their history but I have one or two surmises 
One is that they were established or gained eminence under pressure provided by these same immigrants from whom the old families wished to segregate their children 
In the early days of a homogeneous population the public school was quite satisfactory 
Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English 
Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner Von Heidenstam the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago 
Equally a master of prose and verse he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present 
In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself 
Heidenstam was born in 1859 of a prosperous family 
On his father's side he was of German descent on his mother's he came of the old Swedish nobility 
The family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Vattern in south central Sweden 
It is a lonely rather desolate region but full of legendary and historic associations 
As a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of Sweden's ancient glory 
He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part 
Being somewhat delicate in health at the age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe for which he at once developed a passion so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad at first in Italy then in Greece Egypt Asia Minor and Palestine 
In one of his summers at home he married to the great disapproval of his father who objected because of his extreme youth 
Deciding to become a painter he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris where he enjoyed the life of the artists but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction 
He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem The Happy Artists 
I scanned the world through printed symbol swart And through the beggar's rags I strove to see The inner man 
I looked unceasingly With my cold mind and with my burning heart 
In this final line we have the key to his nature 
Few writers have better understood their deepest selves 
Heidenstam could never be satisfied by surface 
It may however be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris 
The first result of Heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was a volume of poems Pilgrimage And Wander-Years Vallfart och Vandringsar published in 1888 
It was a brilliant debut so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets as did Byron's Childe Harold 
Professor Fredrik Book Sweden's foremost critic of the period acclaims it as follows In this we have the verse of a painter 
strongly colorful plastic racy vivid 
In a bold sometimes careless form there is nothing academic 
all is seen and felt and experienced the observation is sharp and the imagination lively 
The young poet-painter reproduces the French life of the streets 
he tells stories of the Thousand and One Nights and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus 
In the care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence and for that reason he loves it 
And yet amid all the gay hedonism in Pilgrimage And Wander-Years is a cycle of short poems Thoughts In Loneliness filled with brooding melancholy and sombre longing 
Of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as Nameless And Immortal which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language 
It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of Neptune at Paestum next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in existence 
On the eve of his return to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection 
The supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled says the wife her husband has achieved immortality 
Not so he answers it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal 
The man's true reputation is his work 
The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as Thoughts in Loneliness is as Professor Book indicated in sharp contrast with the others 
It consists of fragmentary personal revelations such as The Spark There is a spark dwells deep within my soul 
To get it out into the daylight's glow Is my life's aim both first and last the whole 
It slips away it burns and tortures me 
That little spark is all the wealth I know That little spark is my life's misery 
A dominant motive is the poet's longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations Not men-folk but the fields where I would stray The stones where as a child I used to play 
He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading 
What he really wants is to find a sacred cause to which he can honestly devote himself 
This restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in Sweden 
His cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present 
He did not however find himself at once 
His next major work completed in 1892 was a long fantastic epic in prose entitled Hans Alienus which Professor Book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth 
The hero who is himself is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East a sort of Faustus type who to quote from Professor Book again even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life 
He is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of Tiveden 
From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self 
By the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions 
He did not however settle back into acquiescence with things as they were 
Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity 
He saw Sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory 
Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build anew from the ground up 
Heidenstam's conception on the contrary was to revive the present by the memories of the past 
Whether in prose or poetry all of Heidenstam's later work was concerned with Sweden 
With the first of a group of historical novels The Charles Men Karolinerna published in 1897-8 he achieved the masterpiece of his career 
In scope and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's War And Peace 
About one-third as long it is less intimate and detailed but better coordinated more concise and more dramatic 
Though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles 12 the true hero is not finally the king himself 
Hence the title of the book referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king 
on the fatal battlefield of Poltava to quote from the novel the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people 
The Charles Men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories each depicting a special phase of the general subject 
Somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature 
They comprise a great variety of scene and interest grim episodes of war idyllic interludes superb canvases of world-shaking events and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters 
The general effect is tragic 
Almost nothing is said of Charles' spectacular victories the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat 
To carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale 
His peculiar gift as had been suggested before is his intensity 
George Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style 
Of few authors is this more true than of Heidenstam 
The Charles Men has a tremendous range of characters of common folk even more than of major figures 
The career of Charles 12 is obviously very similar to that of Napoleon 
His ideal was Alexander of Macedon as Napoleon's was Julius Caesar 
His purpose however was not to establish an empire but to assert the principle of divine justice 
Each aspired to be a god in human form but with each it was a different kind of god 
Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him 
Each is still glorified as a national hero 
The first half of The Charles Men ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709 is more dramatically coherent than the second 
After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous 
Like Napoleon he was the worst of losers 
There are however some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part concerning the reactions of the Swedes in adversity 
Then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness 
This comes out in When The Bells Ring which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes 
In The King's Ride Charles breaks out of a long period of petulance and inertia regains his old self escapes from Turkey and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years 
He finds it in utter misery and desolation 
All his people ask for is no more war 
But he plunges into yet another this time with Norway and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall being only thirty-six years of age when he died 
He had become king at fifteen 
Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling 
From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden 
This is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book A Hero's Funeral written in the form of an impassioned prose poem 
Slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral the shrine of so many precious memories 
The guns are fired the hymns are sung and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors 
As he had longed to be he became the echo of a saga 
Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory 
Excellent in their way they lack the wide appeal of The Charles Men and need not detain us here 
It is different with his volume The Swedes And Their Chieftains Svenskarna och deras Hovdingar a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students 
Admirably written it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries 
Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural as suited to the legendary background 
These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlof 
Especially touching is the chapter The Little Sister about a king's daughter who became a nun in the convent of St. Birgitta 
The record teems with romance and adventure 
Gustaf Vasa is a superb example and Charles 10 the conqueror of Denmark hardly less so 
Of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles 12 it is unnecessary to speak 
Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases but his primary function remains what it has always been to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not 
It is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited 
The mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways 
On the one hand he does not work for a large agency but is almost always self-employed 
As a free-lance investigator the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client 
For this reason he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine 
On the other hand the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases 
no client would ever think of asking him to do such things 
Whatever his original assignment the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime usually a murder 
Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves 
He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so frequently he does not receive a fee at all but because he enjoys his work because he firmly believes that murder must be punished 
Thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman 
He is first and foremost a defender of public morals a servant of society 
It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective 
By virtue of his self-reliance his individualism and his freedom from external restraint the private eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost
