He had plenty of work to do
It could be some kind of trick Budd had thought up
My men they all left me
It was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt
Take the pistol
At first I thought he had missed
I saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head bouncing like a rubber ball
